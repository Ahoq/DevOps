            About Tingjun Zhang
        </p>
        <p>
            Hello there, this is Tingjun Zhang. A CS master student from NYU. I take this course to get a hands-on experience of real-world development.
            I am more interested in backend development so I joined in the coding group. I am familiar with Java and nodeJS. This time I will try Django. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, we just create some simple and naive demo projects in the class. But this time, we will create a real-world project during this semester. Exciting!
        </p>
        <p>
            Brief introduction of the book would be updated here.
