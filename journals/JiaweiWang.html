        As a CS student that will graduate from NYU and begin my career this summer,
        I'm having passion in all kinds of knowledge that will help me to become a
        qualified software engineer in the future. For example, the knowledge of the
        full developemnt cycle and cooperation,the knowledge about workflow and communication,etc.
