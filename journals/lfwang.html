            Hi, here is Linfeng Wang. A CS master student in NYU. 
            We gonna use DevOps method to build a DevOps concern website to introduce and practice DevOps. Sounds like a philosophy of life and nature.
            I responsible for coding in a group of ~10, and here is what I do in those weeks.

        Week 3
        <br />
        This week we(<a href="https://gcallah.github.io/DevOps/journals/tingjun.html">Tingjun Zhang</a> and I) are allocated for task "Integred NYU Class, Stack and Trello to our website". 
        We had the open source LMS(Learning Management System) called Sakai, which is the basement of NYU Classes. We also get some help from our NYU Classes developer Jeff Pasch. He give us the <a href="https://newclasses.nyu.edu/direct/describe">particular API</a> that NYU Classes uses.
        I also successful got JSON from our NYU Classes with the condition of complete and maintaining <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/it/mfa">NYU Multi-Factor Authentication</a> in advance.

        Week 4
        <br />

        This Friday, we have a video meeting with Jeff. He told us that if we want to avoid Multi-Factor Authentication, we could use instructor's account to create annoucements.
        First, we try to show Trello and Stack on website by html or javascript. But I found out that Trello now must use its RESTful API to get infos, so if we want to do so, we need to decode those info and write an UI on our website to show info.
        There was a quick task for us in this week. The website has a html checker now and it needs a url checker. There are mutural python library tools, so it is easy to achieve.
        We also connected to staff from NYU IT department, they had experience about how to build "/class" command in Slack to create NYU Classes annoucements. We would try that in next week.

        <br />
        Week 5
        <br />

        This week I finally find out what wrong about my python. My python 3 get crashed sometimes and it only happens at specific situation. And I rebuild all my environment before this week task.
        Then I tried to build a new program(script) for stack. Because it is an individual part, I don't think I could commit this part and let others confuse about and rewrite what I just uploaded. In another word, it is not a part could use agile method, it should be the smallest unsplitable unit in our task.

            The author first suppose a question: What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order? 
            It is so complicated for a single person to explain and the solution would not merely "given" by society as a totality.
            <br />
            On the contrary,  all individuals in our society poessess some part of the answer to this question. The author believes that there may not have a simple, mathematics logic to explain "why it happens," but he could say, as an individual, the diverse paths of reasoning have converged, because of their vision.

            Anyway, there must be someone need to decide what the whole system should do. We call that process: planning. Usually, planning means "central planning" - direction of the whole system according to one unified plan. And the other side of central planning is competition, a decentralized planning process. These two process decide the organization of modern industries and companies.
