            Being a cybersecurity major, I wanted to get a taste of software engineering. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of a DevOps course, I decided to take it. Security is being given more emphasis than ever in the software engineering lifecycle, and I felt I needed to learn more about being a part of it. In addition, I felt that the course would give me the necessary skills when I join the industry after I graduate.

            DevOps is where the industry is moving towards. Being a combination of Lean and Agile practices, DevOps enables the maximum utilization of the skills of a software engineering team.
