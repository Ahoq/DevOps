        <p>
            Being a cybersecurity major, I wanted to get a taste of software
            engineering. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of
            a DevOps course, I decided to take it. Security is being given
            more emphasis than ever in the software engineering lifecycle,
            and I felt I needed to learn more about being a part of it. In
            addition, I felt that the course would give me the necessary
            skills when I join the industry after I graduate.
        </p>
        <p>
            DevOps is where the industry is moving towards. Being a
            combination of Lean and Agile practices, DevOps enables the
            maximum utilization of the skills of a software engineering team.
