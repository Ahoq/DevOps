                Week 3: Over the past week, I was engrossed in watching NetFlix 'Roosevelts' Documentary. The documentary involves around how two (Teddy and FDR) of the most influential President's of USA helped to change the course of the country during the most severe times (Depression, WW2).

                At the devops side, I read about more and more built tool which are currently available for the disposal of developers. I have researched about PyBuilt which involves around Python Projects and I am currently writing a review on it.

                Week 2: We completed the proper installation of Docker and ran our DevOps website inside the new container that we created. 
                It is just amazing to see how light Docker is from Virtualization. Insted of providing us with multiple operating systems, Docker provides us with container that can hold many applications. This is suitable for micro-services architecture.

                Being a graduate student, I always seek to gain maximum industry level exposure. Therefore, during summer 2017 I interned as Academic Student Worker at NYU Information Technology. I developed plugin that aided faculty members to have an organized view of the students enrolled in their classes. I achieved this project by using newest technologies such as NodeJS, MongoDB and AWS to improve my learning curve. During the part of this internship, my mentors introduced me to the concept of DevOps. Lately, as agile team 4 developers and 3 student workers we tranformed the two of the most widely used services NYU Web Publishing and NYU Classes to perform in a DevOps based SCRUM environment. I came across variety of technologies such as Jenkins, Ansible, Maven that helped us with continuous integration. I am very much looking forward to start my career in this dynamic and exciting field.
