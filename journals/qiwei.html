          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Qiwei Zhou, a graduate student in NYU Tandon School of Engineering. By taking this course on DevOps, I am hoping to get a better understanding of how software development works in industry. Through participation and practice, I wish I can learn what processes and procedures the real world software engineers have adopted to make development more efficient and also why they are doing this.

          We will be doing a whole-class project this semester and we have a really HUGE team! It's an honor to be a part of this magnificent project. Good luck!

          Working with my teammates to update the stylesheet for our website. After discussion, we decide to work on the index page first. The three os of us will be working on three different styles so we can compare with each other when we finish with the index page. Next, we will meet and sort out a final style for the entire website. We agree to start as soon as possible since we may find better styles when we begin to implement.

          Just finished with my new style for the index page. A new navigation bar is added and the contents are reorganized in a grid system. Also switched to a brighter colour theme. These should make our website feel more like an IT site.
