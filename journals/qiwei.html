          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Qiwei Zhou, a graduate student in NYU Tandon School of Engineering. By taking this course on DevOps, I am hoping to get a better understanding of how software development works in industry. Through participation and practice, I wish I can learn what processes and procedures the real world software engineers have adopted to make development more efficient and also why they are doing this.
