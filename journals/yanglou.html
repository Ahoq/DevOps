            Expected Outcomes: By taking the DevOps course, I am hoping to gain a solid understanding of what DevOps is all about, 
            and get real experience with DevOps tools and practices. In addition, I plan to creat a functional website with other 
            coding team members using Django as the backend. I will also learn techniques and processes utilized by other teams such 
            as Build, Cloud, Depolyment, Monitoring, Security and Testing.
