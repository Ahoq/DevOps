        <p>
          As a graduate student expecting to graduate soon,
          I have gained quite a few development skills and know-hows of platforms,
          infrastructure and frameworks working in tandem.
          However, as a developer I often find myself annoyed by the fact
          that a lot of time and effort has to be spent on the
          "bureaucracy" (searching for euphemism..) of everything,
          from setting up the evironment, the testing framework to the deployment
          and redeployment of the releases. Working on a solo project,
          one has to worry about all of these, apart from writing a working and efficient code.
          One of the reasons I would release large updates rather than small incremental ones
          would be to reduce this "inconvenience", not that it helped.
          How I wished all of this could be automated!!

          So here I am trying to learn how.
