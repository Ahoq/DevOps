        After completing my undergraduate studies, I worked at Sapient where I was exposed to Agile development technique. As a fresh undergrad, I had never experienced the true utilities of reliable tests and fast releases but it soon became clear to me how important these are to run a production system. I also learned the significance of close collaboration between development, testing and the release team which is absolutely essential to ensure that the incremental changes are rolled out in a smooth fashion. In Maurice Kherlakian’s words, “A phased approach to continuous delivery is not only preferable, it’s infinitely more manageable.”

        After working at Sapient for 3 years, I wanted to increase my breadth in the field of Computer Science and I applied for a Master’s Degree at NYU. During my course projects, I tried to employ the same techniques I learned at Sapient to ensure that the incremental changes are tested and it allowed efficient collaboration with my peers. I did an internship at IBM where I worked on automation testing which was used to reliably test and release Db2 Data Warehouse functionalities specifically Snapshot Backup and Restore. Before my work, testing was done using shell scripts. I used a docker testing container which highly simplified the automation setup as it could be easily pulled on a new cluster to kickoff automation. During my internship, I realized that automating a process exposes the deficiencies of the underlying system pretty soon and incentivizes us to fix them. As Bill Gates said, “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”

        During my internship at IBM, I participated in a multi location Hackathon which involved live training provided by IBM software engineers from a variety of domains. We were a team of 5 people working on building an application for crowdfunding and crowdsourcing using blockchain technology. I got a chance to use the Continuous Delivery Pipeline on IBM Cloud to build and deploy the application code. Code commits by all team members were live within seconds which kept our code production ready. As Mike Miller also said, “Simply put, things always had to be in a production-ready state: if you wrote it, you darn well had to be there to get it running!” Given the time crunch and lots of tasks to work on during a hackathon Devops practises saved a lot of time. We were able to test the flow of application easily from time to time. I was really fascinated by such tools which work seamlessly pushing incremental changes automatically after code commits.

        I believe there is a lot to explore in this field. Learning from people around you by trying new ideas, using new tools and integrating it together on a real project is definitely something that will help me understand why Devops is so  crucial in the software industry today.
