        After completing my undergraduate studies, I worked at 
        Sapient where I was exposed to Agile development technique.
        As a fresh undergrad, I had never experienced the true 
        utilities of reliable tests and fast releases but it soon 
        became clear to me how important these are to run a 
        production system. I also learned the significance of close
        collaboration between development, testing and the release 
        team which is absolutely essential to ensure that the 
        incremental changes are rolled out in a smooth fashion. In 
        Maurice Kherlakian’s words, <font color="#9cd"> <i> “A 
        phased approach to continuous delivery is not only 
        preferable, it’s infinitely more manageable.” </i> </font>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        After working at Sapient for 3 years, I wanted to increase
        my breadth in the field of Computer Science and I applied
        for a Master’s Degree at NYU. During my course projects, I
        tried to employ the same techniques I learned at Sapient to
        ensure that the incremental changes are tested and it 
        allowed efficient collaboration with my peers. I did an 
        internship at IBM where I worked on automation testing 
        which was used to reliably test and release Db2 Data 
        Warehouse functionalities specifically Snapshot Backup and
        Restore. Before my work, testing was done using shell 
        scripts. I used a docker testing container which highly 
        simplified the automation setup as it could be easily 
        pulled on a new cluster to kickoff automation. During my 
        internship, I realized that automating a process exposes 
        the deficiencies of the underlying system pretty soon and 
        incentivizes us to fix them. As Bill Gates said, <font color
        ="#9cd"> <i>“The first rule of any technology used in a 
        business is that automation applied to an efficient 
        operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that
        automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify
        the inefficiency.”</i> </font>
        </p>

        <p>
        During my internship at IBM, I participated in a multi 
        location Hackathon which involved live training provided by 
        IBM software engineers from a variety of domains. We were a 
        team of 5 people working on building an application for 
        crowdfunding and crowdsourcing using blockchain technology.
        I got a chance to use the Continuous Delivery Pipeline on 
        IBM Cloud to build and deploy the application code. Code 
        commits by all team members were live within seconds which
        kept our code production ready. As Mike Miller also said, 
        <font color="#9cd"> <i>“Simply put, things always had to be
        in a production-ready state: if you wrote it, you darn well
        had to be there to get it running!”</i> </font> Given the 
        time crunch and lots of tasks to work on during a hackathon 
        Devops practises saved a lot of time. We were able to test
        the flow of application easily from time to time. I was 
        really fascinated by such tools which work seamlessly 
        pushing incremental changes automatically after code 
        commits.

        I feel that taking the Devops course will help me learn how 
        to use Devops practices to produce a valuable product for 
        the customers. Recent readings about Devops has made me 
        develop a better understanding about it on the whole. I 
        found the following Devops periodic table and am really 
        excited to use some of the tools on a real project.

        This course also puts us in an environment where each team
        is focussing on a different aspect of DevOps, creating an 
        environment like the one we experience in the software 
        industry where everybody works towards a common goal. Such 
        an environment stimulates a faster learning curve through 
        collaboration resulting in a more reliable and sustainable 
        software development.
