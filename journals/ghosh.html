        In the past I have worked in the development team for three years using the Agile methodologies. It became clear to me that collaboration with the testing team, infrastructure team as well as the release team was very important to get good feeback from the client about the developed features and make them happy.
        I used Devops tools during a Hackathon at IBM. I used Continuous Delivery Pipeline on IBM Bluemix to build and deploy the application code. I was surprised to see the incremental changes go live within seconds. From that point I have wondered how this pipeline is developed to work seemlessly to push code changes into production so fast.

        <h2> Expectations </h2>
        <p>
        Eager to learn the Devops paradigm by getting answers to lots of questions and using the tools on a real project to see Devops in action.
        </p>
        <h3> Questions </h3>
        <ol>
        <li>What is Continuous Deployment?</li>
        <li>Learning about different tools used in the Devops marketplace? How to choose tools for a particular software?
        </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
        <h3>Hands-on </h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Exploring tools used in the software industry.</li>
        <li>Learning about the integration of different parts of the software lifecycle.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        
       
        <p>
        I believe there is a lot to explore in this field. Learning from people around you by trying new ideas, using new tools and integrating it together on a real project is definitely something that will help me understand why Devops is so  crucial in the software industry today.
