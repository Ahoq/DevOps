        <h4>Feb 26, 2018 : Week 3, 4</h4>
            Here's a documentation of what we have done so far in terms of codes and commands:

            1: Install Docker : <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-docker"> Get Docker</a> <br> 
            2: Download docker image for Nginx: docker pull nginx <br>
            3: Create a Docker container using command as follow:<br>

                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    docker run --name DevopsNginx -p 8080:80 -v /Users/garima/Documents/Devops/DevOps:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
                </div>
                <br>    
                where --name is to specify the name of container being created. In above example, container name is 'DevopsNginx'<br>
                -p is used for 'port mapping'. Here, 8080:80 specifies that port 8080 will now listen to port 80<br>
                -v is used for 'volume mapping'. In above example, /usr/share/nginx/html is mounted to /Users/garima/Documents/Devops/DevOps (this is the same folder you have cloned the Devops repository to)<br>
            4: Use Kitematic to view all container and their status.

        </p>

        <h4>Feb 14, 2018 : Week 2</h4>
            I have been assigned to the Testing team in this Devops process. Our goal is to create a pipeline with automated testing on the code push before deployment. Our first task was to compare Jenkins, travis CI and GoCD to make a choice for the pipeline. So far I have researched online with reference to GoCD in comparison to Jenkins. Since we are a team of 3 we have equally distributed work amongst us. <br>
            Coming to the book review, I am reviewing 'The Phoenix project' and have completed 3 chapters so far. A detailed review shall be posted on books.html soon.

        <h4>Feb 7, 2018 : Week 1</h4>
            Intro: In Fall'16, I took the Distributed Systems class under Prof. Rosenfeld and was introduced to concepts of Site Reliability, Server Handling, CAP theorem and so on. A class that I took just to learn something new, paved my way into the world of Devops. <br>
            With the little that I could absorb in a span of those 4 months, I stepped into the NYU IT office as a student worker. Under guidance of my mentor and tech lead, I refined my scripting skills, got hands-on GitHub experience and worked in an Agile-SCRUM environment. I was introduced to automated testing, pipelining, deployment for keeping NYU Web Publishing service up and running.<br>
            In Devops Spring 2018 I look forward to team building and collaborative work.
