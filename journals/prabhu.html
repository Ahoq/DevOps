        </h1>
        <p> I was first introduced to the Devops facet of engineering during my
            Internship at Edu.Chat. This was the time when I was simultaneously
        developing and testing using Travis CI. While working on unit tests I
        understood the real meaning of continuous integration tool and how it 
        shapes the Software Development cycle. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I decided to take up the Devops course to explore the testing phase 
        of software development and build a strong understanding of various 
        tools that can be used in the software development life cycle and 
        also to understand which tools to use in which situation</p>
