            <p>
              As a graduate student expecting to graduate soon,
              I have gained quite a few development skills and know-hows of
              platforms, infrastructure and frameworks working in tandem.
              However, as a developer I often find myself annoyed by the fact
              that a lot of time and effort has to be spent on the
              "bureaucracy" (searching for euphemism..) of everything,
              from setting up the evironment, the testing framework to the
              deployment and redeployment of the releases. Working on a solo
              project, one has to worry about all of these, apart from writing a
              working and efficient code. One of the reasons I would release
              large updates rather than small incremental ones would be to
              reduce this "inconvenience", not that it helped. How I wished all
              of this could be automated!!
              <br>
              So here I am trying to learn how.

              <li>Week 1 and 2 : I joined the 'coding' team and picked
                'Practical Devops - Joakim Verona' to study and review. Within
                the coding team, we divided the group into pairs to target the
                various tasks on the Trello board. My first assignment would be
                to work on an html spell-checker.
