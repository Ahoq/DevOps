            <p>
              As a graduate student expecting to graduate soon,
              I have gained quite a few development skills and know-hows of
              platforms, infrastructure and frameworks working in tandem.
              However, as a developer I often find myself annoyed by the fact
              that a lot of time and effort has to be spent on the
              "bureaucracy" (searching for euphemism..) of everything,
              from setting up the evironment, the testing framework to the
              deployment and redeployment of the releases. Working on a solo
              project, one has to worry about all of these, apart from writing a
              working and efficient code. One of the reasons I would release
              large updates rather than small incremental ones would be to
              reduce this "inconvenience", not that it helped. How I wished all
              of this could be automated!!
              <br>
              So here I am trying to learn how.

                Week 1 and 2 : I joined the 'coding' team and picked
                'Practical Devops - Joakim Verona' to study and review. Within
                the coding team, we divided the group into pairs to target the
                various tasks on the Trello board. My first assignment would be
                to work on an html spell-checker.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 3: I paired with Pravar to push the initial release of the
                 spell-checker. This week we learned about Docker and had some
                 hands-on with it. We could leverage a docker container to
                 develop locally with a Django container which could be deployed
                 as is to the cloud provider of choice.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 4: This week we added certain critical features to the
                 spell-checker. It can now add new words to dictionary and
                 extract word between punctuations. We also met with Professor
                 Callahan to discuss the progress with the tool. Professor
                 made some great recommendations and we look forward to
                 implementing them.
