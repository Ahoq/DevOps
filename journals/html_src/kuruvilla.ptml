        <p>
            Being a cybersecurity major, I wanted to get a taste of software 
            engineering. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of 
            a DevOps course, I decided to take it. Security is being given 
            more emphasis than ever in the software engineering lifecycle, 
            and I felt I needed to learn more about being a part of it. In 
            addition, I felt that the course would give me the necessary 
            skills when I join the industry after I graduate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            DevOps is where the industry is moving towards. Being a 
            combination of Lean and Agile practices, DevOps enables the 
            maximum utilization of the skills of a software engineering team.
