  Feb 14, 2018 : Week 2
 I have been assigned to the Testing team in this Devops process. Our goal is to create a pipeline with automated testing on the code push before deployment. Our first task was to compare Jenkins, travis CI and GoCD to make a choice for the pipeline. So far I have researched online with reference to GoCD in comparison to Jenkins. Since we are a team of 3 we have equally distributed work amongst us. 
Coming to the book review, I am reviewing 'The Phoenix project' and have completed 3 chapters so far. A detailed review shall be posted on books.html soon.

  Feb 7, 2018 : Week 1
Intro: In Fall'16, I took the Distributed Systems class under Prof. Rosenfeld and was introduced to concepts of Site Reliability, Server Handling, CAP theorem and so on. A class that I took just to learn something new, paved my way into the world of Devops. 
With the little that I could absorb in a span of those 4 months, I stepped into the NYU IT office as a student worker. Under guidance of my mentor and tech lead, I refined my scripting skills, got hands-on GitHub experience and worked in an Agile-SCRUM environment. I was introduced to automated testing, pipelining, deployment for keeping NYU Web Publishing service up and running.
In Devops Spring 2018 I look forward to team building and collaborative work.
