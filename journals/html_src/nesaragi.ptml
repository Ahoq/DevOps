            Being a Computer Science Graduate Student,it's one of the necessity to comprehend DevOps. The Software World is fast driven and it has become mandatory to satisfy customers in a definitive short span. I was thrilled when NYU introduced DevOps course for the first time and I instantly made up my mind to enroll for this course.

            I really hope to make most out of the course and since I never worked on Testing tools as much as I intended to, I wish to learn more about Testing in this course as well as to comprehed entire architecture of DevOps by the end of this semester.
