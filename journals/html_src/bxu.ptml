          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Bowei Xu and I am a graduate student pursuing Master degree
          of Computer Science in Tandon School of engineering. I am taking this
          course to learn about this popular software engineering culture and
          prepare for the future career. I am excited to learn about the history
          and motivation of this culture and what the benefits it could bring to
          our engineers. Also I would like to know the advantage and disadvantage
          compared to other engineering culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I do look forward to the whole-class project for excising so we can
          experience how powerful DevOps could be in real-world development progress.

          <br/>
          We build the Team page for our team to provide all information on it.
          We present our new UI to the whole class and get suggestion from
          customers. And we also start tesing and immigrating the styles into
          original one.
        </p>

          <br/>
          We have almost finish the migration of style sheet this week and start
          working on the web reconstruction. A common header and footer that
          would be included in all pages are in working process now.
