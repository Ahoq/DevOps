        <h3>Expected Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>
            By taking the DevOps course, I am hoping to
            gain a solid understanding of what DevOps is
            all about, and get real experience with DevOps
            tools and practices. In addition, I plan to
            create a functional website with other coding
            team members using Django as the backend. I
            will also learn techniques and processes
            utilized by build, cloud, deployment, monitoring,
            security and testing teams.
        </p>

        <h3>Weekly Journal</h3>
        <p>
            Week 1:
            <br/>
            Read required documents for the DevOps course.
            I learned DevOps is a software development
            methodology which uses Agile and lean principles
            to improve collaboration between development
            and operations engineers. The traditional waterfall
            model comprises five phases including requirements,
            design, implementation, verification and maintenance.
            DevOps enables faster feedback loops that result
            from delivering smaller batches of code more often,
            compared with the waterfall model.

            Week 2:
            <br/>
            During the class, we cloned the professor's DevOps
            repository, and were taught to use git submodule
            commands. Our personal journal webpages for the
            DevOps course were created locally and then pushed
            to the DevOps repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 3:
            <br/>
            The TA instructed us to download and install the
            docker toolbox, pull the nginx image from docker
            hub, and create a docker container to run the
            DevOps website inside. The professor elaborated
            some advantages to use docker when developing software.
            I and another coding team member were assigned to
            the task "Build quiz mechanism for Django".
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 4:
            <br/>
            Read part of the book Manifesto for Agile Software
            Development. Got Django running locally for
            DevOpsCourse. I taught myself how to use Django as a
            beginner. The professor explained the reasons to
            edit ptml files first. We used build automation tool
            Make to generate html files and rebuilt the DevOps
            website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 5:
            <br/>
            For the task "Build quiz mechanism for Django", the
            Question and Answer models with appropriate fields
            were created, the model changes to the database were
            migrated, the models were registered with the admin
            site, and urls and views were properly set.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 6:
            <br/>
            Filled some questions and corresponding data into
            the database and tested out the functionalities of
            the website locally. Made some changes to the code
            so that the admin site shows the text content of
            questions and answers instead of showing all questions
            and answers as object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 7:
            <br/>
            Reviewed Tom Limoncelli's slides on DevOps, and gained
            a deeper understanding about some concepts of DevOps.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 8:
            <br/>
            We modified the Dango quizzes site to display all 
            questions and corresponding answers in a single page.
            We also implemented the mechanism to calculate the 
            quiz taker's quiz score and added the result page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 9:
            <br/>
            We used project styles for our django quizzes site, 
            and also added the quiz model. Attended Joe's talk 
            on DevOps and his work experience.
