        <h3>Expected Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>
            By taking the DevOps course, I am hoping to
            gain a solid understanding of what DevOps is
            all about, and get real experience with DevOps
            tools and practices. In addition, I plan to 
            creat a functional website with other coding 
            team members using Django as the backend. I 
            will also learn techniques and processes 
            utilized by build, cloud, depolyment, monitoring,
            security and testing teams.

        <h3>Weekly Journal</h3>
        <p>
            Week 1:
            <br/>
            Read required documents for the DevOps course.
            I learned DevOps is a software development 
            methodology which uses Agile and lean principles
            to improve collaboration between development 
            and operations engineers. The traditional waterfall 
            model comprises five phases including requirements, 
            design, implementation, verification and maintenance. 
            DevOps enables faster feedback loops that result 
            from delivering smaller batches of code more often, 
            compared with the waterfall model.
