            The author first suppose a question: What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order? 
            It is so complicated for a single person to explain and the solution would not merely "given" by society as a totality.
            <br />
            On the contrary,  all individuals in our society poessess some part of the answer to this question. The author believes that there may not have a simple, mathematics logic to explain "why it happens," but he could say, as an individual, the diverse paths of reasoning have converged, because of  (something maybe in the next paragraph).
