                    According to Wikipedia, “DevOps (a clipped compound
                    of “software development” and “information technology
                    operations”) is a term used to refer to a set of
                    practices that emphasize the collaboration and
                    communication of both software developers
                    and information technology (IT) professionals while
                    automating the process of software delivery and
                    infrastructure changes.”

                    DevOps is a combination of software development,
                    operations and Quality Assurance. If you are a DevOps
                    professional, chances are that some of the top
                    companies are looking for people like you.

                    I realised the importance of DevOps at my summer
                    internship. There were lot of buzzwords related to
                    DevOps that kept going around and I had to constantly
                    look them up. I wish I had taken  or could take a
                    DevOps course. Luckily Professor Callahan was
                    going to take a DevOps course in Spring 2018! This
                    course is new at NYU and I am happy to be a student
                    and a contributor to it.
