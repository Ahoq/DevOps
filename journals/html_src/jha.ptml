            According to Wikipedia, “DevOps (a clipped compound of “software 
            development” and “information technology operations”) is a term 
            used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the 
            collaboration and communication of both software developers 
            and information technology (IT) professionals while automating 
            the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.” 
         

            DevOps is a combination of software development, operations and 
            Quality Assurance. If you are a DevOps professional, chances are 
            that some of the top companies are looking for people like you.
            
        
            I realised the importance of DevOps at my summer internship. 
            There were lot of buzzwords related to DevOps that kept going 
            around and I had to constantly look them up. I wish I had taken 
            or could take a DevOps course. Luckily Professor Callahan was 
            going to take a DevOps course in Spring 2018! This course is new 
            at NYU and I am happy to be a student and a contributor to it.
