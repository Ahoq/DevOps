<h><b>Week 1 and 2</b></h>
        <p>
I am Om Narayan graduate student at NYU majoring in Computer Science. I took this course to learn and practice DevOps software engineering culture by developing a project by exercising this culture. I hope to get acquainted with various tools used and their working which streamlines the operation of projects. I am curious to know about its evolution and reason behind it global acceptance in a diverse organization and. Its recently gained popularity has piqued my interest know how and why it has outscored and outperformed various traditional practices.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I believe to expertise this practice by the end of this course which can make me professionally competent to stand out of crowd when I got out to a real-world.

        </p>
   <h><b> Week 3</b></h>

<p>
    This week work was to get acquainted with the tools like Docker used in Development and Testing purpose. I got a hands-on experience by installing Docker, running docker images inside a container and then building code inside it locally.
</p>

<h><b> Week 4</b></h>
<p>

Week4 was more geared towards understanding the web-application from a security standpoint. We analyzed various upstream and downstream system and how they are connected and how they communicate. This helped in analyzing various attack surfaces of the system which was used to create threat-model.
</p>

<h><b> Week 5</b></h>
<p>

We worked mostly to discover a way to attack the system. We went through various resources to gather information about tools which can help to automate the vulnerability discovery and a way to attack the system. 

</p>
<h><b> Week 6</b></h>

<p>

This week I worked on static code analysis of the application source code to check for vulnerability in source code. we will be updating team for the found vulnerability if any. This will help to mitigate vulnerability and potential attacks in early stage of development process.

</p>
<h> <b> Week 7 </b> </h>
<p>
This week work was mostly geared towards setting up envrionment for security testing of the web application. We were able to set up the ZMAP and point it to the web application.

</p>
<h><b>Week 8</b></h>
<p>
This week we tested the vulnerability on the djanjo web application. We used automated tools ZAP which provided a comprehesnive report for potential vulnerability. This report will help developers to fix security bugs in the code.
