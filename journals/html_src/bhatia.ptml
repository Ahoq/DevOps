		Halfway through my Master's at NYU, a senior introduced me with the term DevOps. Googling through the websites, one thing struck for sure, this is something different, and honestly, it took a little while to absorb the concept (..still absorbing). DevOps is a cultural difference and the "continuous delivery or deployment" is practically a better way to offer the product. Feedback and correction on the run, and adaptive integration procedure, naturally sounds like a much pragmatic approach for a satisfactory final product.

		Being a cybersecurity enthusiast, DevOps definitely interest me for a very basic reason that most of the security practitioners emphasize on integrating security at every step of development, however, said that, a very few organizations actually take this suggestion seriously. With DevOps fever in the market, the approach towards security has definitely improved. The security assessment is the way to save the company and product from the avoidable 'hacks' and embarrassment.

		Continuous industry inclination towards DevOps makes it evident that currently, it is the favorable time to get your hands dirty with core principles sphering around it. DevOps has motivated me to keep pushing the horizon and possibilities of quick development fragments, while ensuring and targeting the overall desired quality of the product at the same time.
