            What is DevOps?
        </p>
        <p>
    		DevOps brings together developers and operations, merging them into a single team, and driving them with the idea of mutual support.
			DevOps methodology allows delivering software frequently with minor iterable changes.
    	</p>

        <p>
    		DevOps enables the users to receive new features and updates frequently. The customers receive new features and bug fixes more often and the company becomes more competitive.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		DevOps minimizes the chances of outrages. Even if the outrages do take place, everything can be fixed in a matter of a couple of minutes (sometimes in a matter of a single refresh) and the users wonâ€™t even notice that something is wrong.

            What I wish to gain and learn?
        </p>

        <p>
    		Exposure to lots of open source technologies. Since DevOps is all about integration and automation, I'm looking forward to putting the pieces together and make the real use of them.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		With good knowledge on DevOps, we can propose solutions to make things easier, repeatable and qualitative.
