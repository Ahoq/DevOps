          Brief Introduction
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a graduate student majored in Computer Science in NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
          I take this devops course to learn how the real world is developing real softwares.
          I spent most of my software developing in school, and before I graduate, I really want to
          have a glimpse of how people are developing softwares now, and why the ways of developing software
          is changing. I am excited to participating in this hands-on course to learn DevOps.
