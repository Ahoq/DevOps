        <h3>Expected Outcome of this course:</h3>
        <p>
          My internship experience at Amazon has taught me about how important 'operations' are to a team.
          Amazon emphasizes a lot of importance on operations,  any small changes observed in the critical parameters
          of a service is fixed immediately.  At Amazon, the development and maintenance of services is done
          by the same team.  By doing so we could deliver the deliverables quickly and maintain the services in a good state.

          I was thrilled when I knew that Prof. Callahan introduced 'DevOps' course in Spring 2018.  I immediately
          enrolled in it hoping to extend my knowledge on DevOps.  Now, I feel excited to develop a website "To Learn DevOps"
          by learning and implementing DevOps.  The idea of developing the website is a great idea as it emphasizes that
          <u>DevOps is not a tool but a way of working and I am looking forward to learn that!</u>
