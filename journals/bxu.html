          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Bowei Xu and I am a graduate student pursuing Master degree
          of Computer Science in Tandon School of engineering. I am taking this
          course to learn about this popular software engineering culture and
          prepare for the future career. I am excited to learn about the history
          and motivation of this culture and what the benefits it could bring to
          our engineers. Also I would like to know the advantage and disadvantage
          compared to other engineering culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I do look forward to the whole-class project for excising so we can
          experience how powerful DevOps could be in real-world development progress.
        </p>

          person. And we discuss with the instructor about our achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 4:
          <br/>
          We build the Team page for our team to provide all information on it.
          And we also start tesing and immigrating the styles into original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 5:
          <br/>
          We have almost finish the migration of style sheet this week and start
          working on the web reconstruction. A common header and footer that 
          would be included in all pages are in working process now.
