          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Bowei Xu and I am a graduate student pursuing Master degree
          of Computer Science in Tandon School of engineering. I am taking this course
          to learn about this popular software engineering culture and prepare for
          the future career. I am excited to learn about the history and motivation
          of this culture and what the benefits it could bring to our engineers.
          Also I would like to know the advantage and disadvantage compared to other
          engineering culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I do look forward to the whole-class project for excising so we can experience
          how powerful DevOps could be in real-world development progress.
