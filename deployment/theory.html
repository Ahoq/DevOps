        <p>
        Deployment pipeline is an integral part of Devops toolchain. It enables best practices like <i> continuous integration and continuous delivery </i>. It means software changes are continuously deployed and tested to make it production ready.
        Automation is the key. Deployment automation can be achieved using Jenkins pipeline and tools like puppet, chef or ansible which can turn infrastructure into code.
        Puppet, Chef and Ansible were all built the goal to make it much easier to configure and maintain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers. Thus these tools have drastic impact on big organizations. The smaller ones also benefit as automation and orchestration generally make life easier in an infrastructure of any size.

        <h3> Infrastructure as code </h3>
        <p>
        Infrastructure as code means writing code to manage configurations and automate provisioning of infrastructure in addition to deployments. Infrastructure as code makes the infrastructure <i> reliable, repeatable and fast.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure in a descriptive model, using a versioning tool for infrastructure code. IaC model makes the <i>environment idempotent </i> by generating the same environment, regardless of the environmentâ€™s starting state, every time infrastructure code is applied.
        </p>
        <p>
        Organizations who use IaC can deliver <i> stable environments rapidly and at scale.</i> They can avoid manual configuration of environments and enforce consistency by representing the desired state of their environments via code. Using code to define the server configuration means that there is greater consistency between servers. With manual provisioning different interpretations of imprecise instructions lead to diffirent configurations making it hard to debug in case of faults.
        </p>
        <p>
        Infrastructure as Code techniques scale effectively to manage large clusters of servers, both in configuring the servers and specifying how they should interact. Thus DevOps teams can work together with a unified set of practices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly, reliably, and at scale.
