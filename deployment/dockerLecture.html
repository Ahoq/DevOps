        <p>
            In this webpage we are going to try and host a
             simple static website in nginx using docker.
            I have already talked about what version of 
            docker you should use. If you are using windows 
            then docker-toolbox otherwise just using 
            docker native should be okay for the Mac and 
            linux users. 
            This tutorial is written and performed in MacBook 
            computer. Windows users 
            should not have any problem performing the same steps 
            in windows, but if you
            find yourself stuck somewhere please send me a slack
             message, I will try to help you out.
        </p>

        <p>
            First step is to download and install docker, 
            which I am sure everyone in the class did.
             If not please visit <a>http://www.docker.com</a>. 
            You should follow the installation instructions
             given in the website.
        </p>

        <h4> 
            Download the nginx image 
        </h4>

        <p>
            Let's run the following command in terminal/quickstart-terminal. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <code> docker images </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This command should give you the list of images 
            that are available in the system. For example 
            in my system it looks something like 
            this. Yours might have a different than what I have.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img width="60%" src="../build/graphics/docker_images.png"
                alt="docker images">
            <figcaption>
                List of images in my system
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As you can see that I don't have the nginx image
            install. I will run the following command which will
            install the nginx image for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <code>
            docker pull nginx
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have installed the nginx image,
            just run the docker images command again,
            in the list you should see ngnix image just like
            down below.
        </p>
         <figure>
            <img width="60%" src="../build/graphics/docker_images_again.png"
                alt="docker images">
            <figcaption>
                List of images in my system now with nginx
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4> 
            Download website code
        </h4>

        <p>
            Ok now that you have download the nginx image,
            let's download the static website that you
            are going to host inside the docker container.
            We are going to use the algorithms website for
            professor's other subject. You can find the 
            code for the website to 
            <a href="http://gitub.com/gcallah/algorithms.git">
            algorithms
            </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Please remember the location where you have 
            cloned the repository. I have cloned it in
            <code> /Users/prashant/school/algorithms</code>
            you's will be different than this, please note 
            the location. Below is the screenshot of algorithms
            directory.
        </p>
         <figure>
            <img width="60%" src="../build/graphics/algorithms.png" alt="docker images">
            <figcaption>
                List of images in my system now with nginx
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h4> 
            Let's make a container
        </h4>

        <p>
            Ok, so we have downloaded the nginx image and
            the code of the website which we want to host
            All we need to do is just make a container
            out of the image. We will put the code of 
            website inside the container so that the
            webserver which is nginx in our case can 
            read the html files and host it in local
            server.
            The command for that is as shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                docker run --name algo_website -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80
                -v /Users/prashant/school/algorithms/:/usr/share/nginx/html
                -d nginx
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Please don't forget to change the location of
             algorithms directory in above command. 
             After you run the command open the browser 
             and type http://localhost:8080 and you
             should be able to see the webpage. 
             Windows user should use the address
             http://192.168.99.100:8080 instead of localhost. 
        </p>
