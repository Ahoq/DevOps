                Apk- to install python 3,
                Alpine-sdk to give us awk, make and git

                WhoamI can be run inside the container and outside the
                container and we can get two different results
                Same thing for Hostname, does not give us the same hostname                 numbers 

                370+ processes being run 
                only 2 are running inside the container- bash and ps -ef

                There is 8 Docker processes running even for docker.
                From the point of view of the host, the container looks just
                like a process but ...

                process namespace, network namespace, etc all hidden from

                Has its own file namespace.
