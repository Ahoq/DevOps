            <u><b>ANSIBLE Modules</b></u>
        </h1>
		
      	
		<p> 
		In this section, we will walkthrough common modules with their implementation and explanation<br/></br>
		</p>


        <p><b>EXAMPLE 1: Copy file from a local machine to a remote server</b> </p>

    <p> The copy module copies a file from the local or remote machine to a location on the remote machine. Use the fetch module to copy files from remote locations to the local box. For Windows targets, use the win_copy module instead.

        <pre>
        - hosts: blocks
          tasks:
            - name: Copy a file from local to remote server
              copy:
                src: ~/Users/test_file.txt
                dest: /tmp
                mode: u=rw,g=r,o=r
        </pre>

       <p> The above example describes simple module for copying a file from one system to another with specific mode and permission for users, group and others. </p>
    </p>
        <br>
        <br>

         <p><b>EXAMPLE 2: Access Control List - Set and Retrieve file ACL information</b> </p>

    <p> Sets and retrieves file ACL information.

        <pre>
        - hosts: blocks
          tasks:
            - name: Grant user John read access to a file
            acl:
                path: /etc/acl.conf
                entity: John
                etype: user
                permissions: r
                state: present
        </pre>

       <p> The above example describes a module for setting up access control permissions for a user to access a particular file or folder. An entity can be a user as well as a group of users, which may requires certain permissions. </p>
    </p>
