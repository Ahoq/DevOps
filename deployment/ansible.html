		<b>WHAT is Ansible?</b> </br> </br>
		
		Ansible is a task execution engine, which defines a simple automation language for dramatically improving the scalabilty, consistency, reliability of a network or IT infrastructure. Funded and developed under the umbrella of Redhat Enterprise, it is an open-source tool/software/language/system (..and may be magic) which has main utility of configuration management, sever/hosts configuration, continuous integration, and orchestration.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		</br></br>
			
		<b>WHY Ansible?</b> </br> 
		
		<ul>
		<h6>
		<li> <u>Scalable automation</u>: Ansible is designed to work beyond a small group of network devices. Ansible can be used to manage a fleet of infrastructure devices at a low-cost.
		<li> <u>Ease and Simplicity</u>: To accomplish a task YAML formatted files are used, which provides human readability and ease in machine parsing. 
		<li> <u>LAN as well as Remote management</u>: One of the most important feature of ansible is its capability to manage the remote networks.
		<li> <u>Supports Infrastructure, Network, Cloud, Containers</u>: Ansible can automate most of the contemporary infrastructure models from bare metal to virtualization
		</h6>
		</ul>
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		</br>
		<b>ANSIBLE INSTALLATION</b> 
		</br>
		Ansible uses SSH protocol for management of the machines.
		On installation, Ansible does not add any database, or starts any background process. The <b>control machine</b> is installed with ansible, and then it is used to further control other machines (referred as, Nodes) on the same LAN or on remote newtork.
		
		NOTE: Windows is not used as a Control Machine. Ansible official documentation page quotes, <i>"Running Ansible from a Windows control machine directly is not a goal of the project. Refrain from asking for this feature, as it limits what technologies, features, and code we can use in the main project in the future."</i>
		</br> </br>
		
		<u>REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES </u>
		</br>
		<u>Control machine</u>
		</br>
		Basic requirement of a control machine is Python 2 (2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (3.5 or higher). However, only the latest version of Ansible support Python 3, it is still advisable to run Python 2 for the beginners.
		
		</br>
		<u>Nodes</u>
		</br>
		Python 2 (2.6 or 2.7) should be up and running on node machines to be managed.</br>
		SSH, SFTP, SCP are few protocols which can be used as mode of communictaion to manage the nodes. By default SFTP is used, however, it is advisable to switch to SSH.
		
		</br>
		<u>UBUNTU installation </u>
		</br>
		<pre>
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
		$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install ansible
		</pre>
		<p>
		</br>
		<u>MAC installation </u>
		</br>
		
		'pip' is used for easy installation, but it isn't available on OSX by default. So, we can use python's package manager easy_install to install pip.
		<pre> 		$sudo easy_install pip </pre>
		</p>
		</br>

		<p>
		Post pip installation, ansible can be very easy installed on an OSX
		
		<pre>
		$ sudo pip install ansible
		$ sudo pip install ansible --upgrade
		</pre>
		
		<p>On OSX Maverick, compiler might create some issue, which can be easily dealt with following command.
		
		<pre>	$ sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install ansible</pre>
		</p>
		</p>
		</p>

		<b>ANSIBLE INSTALLATION</b> 
		</br>

		<u>Essentials 1: PLAYS and PLAYBOOK</u>
		
		A 'Play' can be simply defined as set of rules which map host or servers in concern to a task or activity. A play basically is used to call for for an ansible module. A playbook is simply defined as a set of multiple plays in a list. 

		As a formal definition, Playbooks are Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process. Ansible playbooks are a way to send commands to remote computers in a scripted way. Instead of using Ansible commands individually to remotely configure computers from the command line, you can configure entire complex environments by passing a script to one or more systems.

		As mentioned in previous section, playbooks are written in YAML, with help of minimum syntaxes and rules. The main intent is to make sure that Ansible is least related to any scripting or programming language.

		EXAMPLE:
		</p>
		<pre>
			---
			- name: install ansible with pip
			- hosts: host1

			tasks:
				-name: ansible pip
				 pip:
				 	name: ansible
				 	virtualenv: ~/ansible_folder
		</pre>
		<p>
		we are using pip module to install ansible package on all the hosts in a particular python virtual environment
