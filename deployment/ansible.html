		<b>WHAT is Ansible?</b> </br> </br>
		
		Ansible is a task execution engine, which defines a simple automation language for dramatically improving the scalabilty, consistency, reliability of a network or IT infrastructure. Funded and developed under the umbrella of Redhat Enterprise, it is an open-source tool/software/language/system (..and may be magic) which has main utility of configuration management, sever/hosts configuration, continuous integration, and orchestration.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		</br></br>
			
		<b>WHY Ansible?</b> </br> 
		
		<ul>
		<h6>
		<li> <u>Scalable automation</u>: Ansible is designed to work beyond a small group of network devices. Ansible can be used to manage a fleet of infrastructure devices at a low-cost.
		<li> <u>Ease and Simplicity</u>: To accomplish a task YAML formatted files are used, which provides human readability and ease in machine parsing. 
		<li> <u>LAN as well as Remote management</u>: One of the most important feature of ansible is its capability to manage the remote networks.
		<li> <u>Supports Infrastructure, Network, Cloud, Containers</u>: Ansible can automate most of the contemporary infrastructure models from bare metal to virtualization
		</h6>
		</ul>
		
		</p>

		</br>
		<b>ANSIBLE INSTALLATION</b> 
		</br>
		Ansible uses SSH protocol for management of the machines.
		On installation, Ansible does not add any database, or starts any background process. The <b>control machine</b> is installed with ansible, and then it is used to further control other machines (referred as, Nodes) on the same LAN or on remote newtork.
		
		NOTE: Windows is not used as a Control Machine. Ansible official documentation page quotes, <i>"Running Ansible from a Windows control machine directly is not a goal of the project. Refrain from asking for this feature, as it limits what technologies, features, and code we can use in the main project in the future."</i>
		</br> </br>
		
		<u>REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES </u>
		</br>
		<u>Control machine</u>
		</br>
		Basic requirement of a control machine is Python 2 (2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (3.5 or higher). However, only the latest version of Ansible support Python 3, it is still advisable to run Python 2 for the beginners.
		
		</br>
		<u>Nodes</u>
		</br>
		Python 2 (2.6 or 2.7) should be up and running on node machines to be managed.</br>
		SSH, SFTP, SCP are few protocols which can be used as mode of communictaion to manage the nodes. By default SFTP is used, however, it is advisable to switch to SSH.
		
		</br>
		<u>UBUNTU installation </u>
		</br>
		<pre>
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
		$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install ansible
		</pre>
		
		</br>
		<u>MAC installation </u>
		</br>
		
		<p>'pip' is used for easy installation, but it isn't available on OSX by default. So, we can use python's package manager easy_install to install pip.</p>
		<pre> sudo easy_install pip </pre>
		
		</br>
		Post pip installation, ansible can be very easy installed on an OSX
		
		<pre>
		$ sudo pip install ansible
		$ sudo pip install ansible --upgrade
		</pre>
		
		On OSX Maverick, compiler might create soem issue, which can be easily dealt with foolowing command.
		
		<pre>$ sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install ansible</pre>
