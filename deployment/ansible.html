		<b>WHAT is Ansible?</b> </br> </br>
		
		Ansible is a task execution engine, which defines a simple automation language for dramatically improving the scalabilty, consistency, reliability of a network or IT infrastructure. Funded and developed under the umbrella of Redhat Enterprise, it is an open-source tool/software/language/system (..and may be magic) which has main utility of configuration management, sever/hosts configuration, continuous integration, and orchestration.

		<b>WHY Ansible?</b> </br> 
		
		<ul>
		<h6>
		<li> <u>Scalable automation</u>: Ansible is designed to work beyond a small group of network devices. Ansible can be used to manage a fleet of infrastructure devices at a low-cost.
		<li> <u>Ease and Simplicity</u>: To accomplish a task YAML formatted files are used, which provides human readability and ease in machine parsing. 
		<li> <u>LAN as well as Remote management</u>: One of the most important feature of ansible is its capability to manage the remote networks.
		<li> <u>Supports Infrastructure, Network, Cloud, Containers</u>: Ansible can automate most of the contemporary infrastructure models from bare metal to virtualization
