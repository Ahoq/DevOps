            A Guide to HTML Coding for the DevOps Course
        </h1>

        <p>
            This is the guide for HTML coding standards and recommended
            practices for a DevOps course, built by Dr. Eugene Callahan
            and his Spring 2018 DevOps class at NYU Tandon.

                Don't create "hand" styles: use the stylesheet!
            </summary>

            <p>
                Hand styles violate the
                <a

                principle! They are a terrible maintenance issue: imagine NYU
                mandates that all class websites use violet text. We change
                the stylesheet, only to find people have created their own
                "styles" in dozens of individual documents.

                No use of editors that insert their own code
            </summary>

            <p>
                Programmers need to use a programming editor for many reasons;
                first of all, because they are built with our needs in mind.
                Programs like Word and Google Docs can edit HTML, but they
                "have their way" with your code. Try editing a 20-line HTML
                file with Word and see what happens!
            </p>

            <summary class="sum4">
                Use spaces not tabs.
            </summary>

            <p>
                Indenting with tabs shows up differently for different people
                depending upon their editor settings: spaces will look the same
                for everyone. A good coding editor can convert tabs to spaces
                automatically.

                Keep line length &lt; 80.
            </summary>

            <p>
                People have small screens, or edit on a phone, or have their
                editor set to wrap at 80. Eighty is the line maximum for
                "approved" Python coding: we might as well use that for HTML.
            </p>

            <summary class="sum4">
                Use the HTML5 outline feature.
            </summary>

            <p>
                This gives the user a quick summary of the page, and then lets
                them drill down on topics of their choice.
            </p>

            <summary class="sum4">
                Keep structural tags on their own line.
            </summary>

            <p>
                This makes it easy to see the structure separately from the
                text. It also makes it easy to delete tags or text but not the
                other.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary class="sum4">
                Indent each nested structural element 4 more spaces.
            </summary>

            <p>
                By visually nesting structures that are logically nested, we
                can more easily see the logical structure, and match end tags.
