          What is a good UI?
        </p>
        <p>
          A good UI gives customers good experience when they visit the
          website. What makes a great UI? Apart from fast response speed, first, it is crucial that all visitors, with or without specific background knowledge, can
          understand what the interface is talking about, like what to fill in this blank and where this button leads. Second, important pages, like index pages or sub-index pages, should be accessible from any other page on the website(by adopting a navigation bar, for instance). Third, UI style should
          be consistent across all pages to strive for smoothest transition when users walk across our web
          pages. Also the style should be adapted to most users' comfort that font, background and other
          elements won't cause negative feeling of customers.

          We have gathered some guide and documentation for UI design:

          For the first version, we want to clear up the web with a more organized UI.
          To acheive this, we first think about adding a navigation
          bar that allows users to access all links anywhere on the website. So after several discussions, we choose the collapsible side bar for the following reason.
          <br/><br/>
          1. The nav bar only occupies a small area of screen, leaving most space for contents.
          <br/>
          2. Animations are cool.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Deployment
        </p>
          <p>
            We are working on a plan to refactor the entire website with our new stylesheet.
            In order to minimize the impact on others' work and make it more flexible for
            future updates, we are thinking about making a global header file that includes all common elements for all pages,
            such as stylesheet, js function and navigation bar. In this way, we could replace all these
            repeating elements by the include clause we currently have and future updates will only take place on this file.
