                <p>
                    For the UX implementation, we use the normal front-end
                    languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS for the animation
                    and stylesheet including font, background, arrangement,
                    collapse effects and etc.. And we applied Bootstrap which
                    helps save time with large front-end library and arrange
                    the layout very handily. Also, Bootstrap contributes well
                    on compatibility which allow the website easily migrated
                    to mobile device.
