          What is a good UI?
        </p>
        <p>
          According to us, a good UI design can give customers good experience when go through the
          website. It must be easy for customers among all levels(age, intellegence and etc.) to use
          and allow user to access information desired as fast as possible. Users should be able to
          access any page in this website from whichever page they are. Also, the interface style should
          be consistent across all pages to strive for smoothest transition when user walk across our web
          pages. Also the style should be adapted to most users' comfort that font, background and other
          elements won't cause negative feeling of customers.

          We have gather some guide and documentation for UI design:

          For the first version, we want to clear up the web with a more organized UI.
          To achive the standard UI standard, we first think about adding a navigation
          bar that allow users to access all links any where. So after several argument
          and result comparison, we choose the collapsible side bar for the following reason.
          <br/><br/>
          1. Leave most effective area for content.
          <br/>
          2. Easy for user to access other links from wherever they are.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Deployment
        <p>
          <p>
            We are working on a effective plan on refactoring the websites with our stylesheet.
            And we want it to minimize the impact to others' work and make it more flexible for
            future update. So we are thinking make a header file that include all common elements
            such as stylesheet, js function and navigation bar. In this way, we could replace all
            repeat elements by some include syntax. Even if UI style changes in future, this could
            minimize the workload.
