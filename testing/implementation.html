            <h3>We have decided to move forward with Jenkins for our CI pipeline.</h3>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            Applications like Jenkins can be downloaded as read-only "images" (or Docker images), each of which is run in Docker as a container. Since we have already downloaded docker in first class, understanding this installation of Jenkins shall be easier.<br>
        
            <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/">Jenkins</a> recommends using  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/">jenkinsci/blueocean</a> image (from the Docker Hub repository).

            This image is for Jenkins LTS and comes bundled with all Blue Ocean plugins so they don't have to be downloaded separately.
            <br>
            Details for downloading Jenkins Docker Image MacOS/linux/Windows can be found <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/">here</a>
