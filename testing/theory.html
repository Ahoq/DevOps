           Importance of testing
        </h1>
        <p>
        Recognition of Error and Faults : Errors may be in unit level or in system level. After going through so many testing the application will be free of errors that may be disturbing the application.
        <br>
        Enhancement in Product Standards : Testing can help to know the real result and the probable result. With proper testing an application can come out of bugs and build up ideal software for the end-users.
        <br>
        Credibility Evaluation : If the software application has gone through all the testing types 
        (like unit testing, regression testing etc.), the application will surely be a reliable one. 
        <br>
        Avoid Fault Immigration : The faults can be noticed first stage of SDLC hence, these may be prohibited from immigrating to the following progress stage.
