            <h2> What is Software Testing?</h2>
                <p>Definition: The process of Evaluation of a system and its 
                components with the intent of validating against specific
                requirements</p>

            <h2>When to start testing?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Cost and rework is reduced when testing starts early in
                    the developement phase.</li>
                    <li> Testing can start from the requirement gathering phase to
                    the deployment phase.</li>
                    <li> Testing takes many forms and depends on the software 
                    development model.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>
               The Importance of Testing
            </h2>

            <ul>
            <li>
            Recognition of Error and Faults : Errors may be in unit level or in
            system level. After going through so many testing the application will
            be free of errors that may be disturbing the application.
            </li>

            <li>
            Enhancement in Product Standards : Testing can help to know the real
            result and the probable result. With proper testing an application can
            come out of bugs and build up ideal software for the end-users.
            </li>
            <li>
            Credibility Evaluation : If the software application has gone through
            all the testing types
            (like unit testing, regression testing etc.), the application will
            surely be a reliable one.
            </li>
            <li>
            Avoid Fault Immigration : The faults can be noticed first stage of SDLC
            hence, these may be prohibited from immigrating to the following
            progress stage.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Testing myths to overcome:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Testing is too expensive.</li>
                    <li>Testing is time-consuming.</li>
                    <li>Only fully developed processes are tested.</li>
                    <li>A tested software is bug-free.<li>
                </ul>
