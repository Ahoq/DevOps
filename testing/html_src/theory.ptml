        <li>
        Recognition of Error and Faults : Errors may be in unit level or in
        system level. After going through so many testing the application will
        be free of errors that may be disturbing the application.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Enhancement in Product Standards : Testing can help to know the real
        result and the probable result. With proper testing an application can
        come out of bugs and build up ideal software for the end-users.
        </li>
        <li>
        Credibility Evaluation : If the software application has gone through
        all the testing types 
        (like unit testing, regression testing etc.), the application will
        surely be a reliable one. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Avoid Fault Immigration : The faults can be noticed first stage of SDLC
        hence, these may be prohibited from immigrating to the following
        progress stage.
        </li>
