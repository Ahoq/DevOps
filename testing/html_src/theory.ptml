            <ul>
            <li>
            Recognition of Error and Faults : Errors may be in unit level or in
            system level. After going through so many testing the application will
            be free of errors that may be disturbing the application.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Enhancement in Product Standards : Testing can help to know the real
            result and the probable result. With proper testing an application can
            come out of bugs and build up ideal software for the end-users.
            </li>
            <li>
            Credibility Evaluation : If the software application has gone through
            all the testing types 
            (like unit testing, regression testing etc.), the application will
            surely be a reliable one. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Avoid Fault Immigration : The faults can be noticed first stage of SDLC
            hence, these may be prohibited from immigrating to the following
            progress stage.
            </li>
