            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p> We have decided to move forward with Jenkins for our CI pipeline.
            For this we need to host Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance 
            and then connect it to the DevOps Github Repository </p>
            <h4>Installing Jenkins on AWS</h4>
                <ul class="nested">
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 1: Creating an AWS EC2 instance</b> 
                      </br>
                        Create an EC2 instance on the AWS 
                        account by 
                        following the routine steps, one thing to keep 
                        in mind is while associating security 
                        group to this EC2 instance
                        make sure the port 8080 is open to the world and 
                        download the secret key.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 2: SSH into the AWS machine</b> </br>
                      Next step is to SSH into the AWS machine using the 
                      credentials downloaded in the previous step.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 3: Configuring and starting Jenkins</b> </br>
                      Follow the steps in the link to configure and 
                      start jenkins <a href="https://github.com/carlosCharz/installjenkinsaws" > Configure and Start Jenkins </a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 4: Initial Jenkins setup </b> </br>
                      After following the previous steps, you need to go 
                      the url which is your public dns of your EC2 
                      instance:8080(E.g. http://ec2-aws.compute:8080) 
                      and follow
                      the steps displayed on the website. After these steps you
                      should be able to see the jenkins server up and running.

            <h4>Here's a way of Trigerring a Jenkins 
            build from a push to Github.</h4>
                <p> A reason to choose Jenkins was the 
                availability of many plugins.
                One such plugin is the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Integration+Plugin">Github Integration Plugin</a>
               </p>

                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>
                    <b>Step 1: Install Github Integration Plugin</b><br>
                    It can be accessed through Plugin Manager under 
                    'available' tab or simply through search box.
                    After checking against the plugin, click on 'Download Now'.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> Step 2: Prepare Github Repository</b><br>
                    We now need to add service to call Jenkins Github 
                    webhook on a push.
                    Inside the github repo, go to Settings - Integrations 
                    & Services - Add service <br>
                    Select Jenkins(Github Integration) from 
                    drop-down menu.
                    In the new window, enter 
                    "Jenkins Hook URL+ "/github-webhook/"
                    e.g. http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/github-webhook/ <br>
                    Click on "test service"
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b>Step 3: Give repo access to Jenkins 
                    User</b><br>
                    This is a very important step. There are 
                    several ways to do so.<br>
                    1. use github OAuth plugin. <br>
                    2. Store plain-text user/password combo on Github
                    <br>
                    To be further discussed..
                    </li>
