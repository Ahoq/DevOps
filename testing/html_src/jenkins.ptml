                Our Evaluation of Jenkins
            </h1>

            <p>
                Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java which
                supports continuous integration.<strong>Hudson</strong> project
                was the precursor to Jenkins which was orignally started by Sun
                Systems, after the acquisition of Sun Systems by Oracle,
                <strong>Jenkins</strong> was forked from Hudson and it's
                independent community was formed. Jenkins is widely used by
                various software industries and the software folks love it.
            </p>
            <h1> Simple workflow of how Jenkins works? </h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Developers change their source code </li>
                <li> Jenkins picks up the changed source code and triggers a 
                     build that runs any tests that are required.</li>
                <li> The build output is available on the Jenkins dashboard. 
                     Automatic notifications can be sent to user regarding code 
                     status </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Jenkins is desirable?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Jenkins is an automation tool that spans across the entire development cycle from Building to Deployment. </li>
                <li> Jenkins has over 1400 plugins that makes is easily accessible across different platforms and frameworks. </li>
                <li> It has a master-slave architechture and allows us to create nodes depending on the task in hand i.e you can create different jenkins node to handle tasks
                     such as build,delpoy,test etc. </li>
                <li> Jenkins supports git and many of the version controls for Source code management.</li>
                <li> It is most active automation server tool installed in the software industry and has an estimation of more than 1 million active users using Jenkins.</li>
                <li> Jenkins uses less memory for installation. </li>
                <li> Jenkins can be installed on almost all of the operating systems. </li>
                <li> The Jenkins Community is vastly large and hence we can get support, if for any issues </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Cons of using Jenkins </h2>
             <li> Allows only Github support </li>
             <li> Not free for private repos </li>
             <li> Does Not provide support for windows users </li>
+            <li> Supports more than a dozen languages </li>
+            <li> Excellent user website interaction </li>
