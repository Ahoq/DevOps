It is essential to understand the difference between CI and CD before we move to comparisons. <br> Continuous Integration (CI) is about everyone merging code changes to a central repository multiple times a day. Each merge triggers an automated build and testing sequence for the given project.
<br>
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice of automating the entire software release process. The idea is to do CI, plus automatically prepare and track a release to production. The desired outcome is that anyone with sufficient privileges to deploy a new release can do so at any time in one or a few clicks. By eliminating nearly all manual tasks, developers become more productive.
         <br><p>
            Here are some of the major testing/continuous integration
            tools and their features:
