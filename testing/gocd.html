        <p>
            GoCD is an open source tool used in software development to achieve continuous delivery (CD) of software. It supports automating the entire build-test-release process from code check-in to deployment. It helps to keep producing valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time.
GoCD was originally developed at ThoughtWorks Studios in 2007 and released as open source in 2014.
<br><ul>
<li>
GoCD can easily model and visualize complex workflows. It is suitable for single purpose, focused tool.
</li><br><li>
GoCD can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Its fan-in/fan-out dependency management ensures that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor pipeline or material.
</li><br><li>
GoCD compare both files and commit messages across any two arbitrary builds, making it easy to troubleshoot a broken pipeline.
</li><br><li>
GoCD provides parallel execution across pipelines, platforms, versions, branches, etc. and helps eliminate bottlenecks.
