        </h1>

        <p>
            Too often, people come to believe they are productive because they
            are <i>doing</i> lots of things. If you asked them for evidence of
            their productivity, they would show you all of the tasks "on their
            plate," i.e., their to-do list.
        </p>

        <p>
           This brings us to the distinction in economics between "stocks" and
           "flows."
