            Using Git and GitHub
        </h1>

        <p>
            Some guidelines for using Git and GitHub in the DevOps class (and
            perhaps in other, future classes as well).
        </p>

                For the purposes of continuous integration, work should usually
                be done on the master branch. Creating other branches should be
                done only in extraordinary circumstances.
            </li>

            <li>
                Use <i>real</i> commit messages that give someone viewing the
                commit an idea of what occurred.

                <b>Bad</b>: "Updated a file."
                <br />
                <b>Good</b>: "Started work on git page and
                added section on commit messages."
            </li>
