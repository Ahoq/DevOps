            Monitoring Theory
        </h1>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Applications now are more business critical than ever. DevOps has 
            brought automation to every stage of the application lifecycle 
            which has significantly increased the speed from development to QA 
            to production. Now there are frequent code commits with developers 
            having to write comprehensive automated tests for their code. 
            Every time a new commit occurs it automatically triggers all the 
            unit and integration tests. Because development is striving more 
            to use a production-like environment, monitoring becomes 
            important. 
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Monitoring provides feedback about the application’s performance 
            and usage patterns. This ensures the health and the availability 
            of our IT systems and services. Effective monitoring is essential 
            to allow DevOps teams to deliver at speed, get feedback from 
            production, and increase customers satisfaction, acquisition and 
            retention.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color = "pink">Synthetic Monitoring:</font>Developers, 
            testers and operations staff all need to ensure that their 
            internet and intranet mobile applications and web applications 
            are tested and operate successfully from different points of 
            presence around the world.
        </p>
        

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color = "pink">Alert Management:</font>Developers, testers 
            and operations staff all need to send notifications via email, 
            voice mail, text, mobile push notifications and Slack messages 
            when specific situations or events occur in development, 
            testing or production environments, to get the right people’s 
            attention and to manage their response.
        </p>
        

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color = "pink">Deployment Automation:</font>Developers, 
            testers and operations staff use different tools to schedule 
            and deploy complex applications and configure them in development, 
            testing and production environments. We will discuss the best 
            practices for these teams to collaborate effectively and 
            efficiently and avoid potential duplication and 
            erroneous information.
        </p>
        

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color = "pink">Analytics:</font>Developers need to be 
            able to look for patterns in log messages to identify if there 
            is a problem in the code. Operations need to do root cause 
            analysis across multiple log files to identify the source of 
            the problem in complex application and systems.
        </p>
        

        <p> <font color = "cyan">   Goals </font></p>
        

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color = "pink">Fault Detection:</font> The primary goal 
            of monitoring is to determine when a resource becomes unavailable 
            or starts to perform poorly. As soon as performance and other 
            issues arise rich diagnostic data is sent back to the development 
            teams.  This is the time to detect(TTD). TTM is the time to 
            mitigate these issues by the DevOps teams. The time taken 
            to mitigate the issues are measured and are improved on. After 
            mitigation, teams work on finding the root cause of the issue 
            so that they do not occur again. This is the time to 
            remediate(TTR).
        </p>
        

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color="pink">Validated Learning:</font> A second goal is 
            validated learning by tracking usage. Every deployment is an 
            opportunity to track experimental results that support or 
            diminish the hypotheses that led to the deployment. Tracking 
            usage and differences between versions allows teams to measure 
            the impact of change and drive business decisions. If a hypothesis 
            is diminished, the team can “fail fast” or “pivot”. If the 
            hypothesis is supported, then the team can double down or 
            “persevere”. These data-informed decisions lead to new hypotheses 
            and prioritisation of the backlog.

        <p> <font color = "cyan"> What is APM ? </font> </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            APM stands for application performance management. APM are 
            solutions that continuously monitor applications in production 
            environments. They let you monitor user experience and improve 
            the stability of the application infrastructure. It helps to 
            identify the root cause of issues quickly to proactively prevent 
            outages and keep users satisfied. By running APM solutions 
            earlier in the life cycle, development teams get feedback in 
            advance of how applications will eventually perform in production 
            and can take corrective action much earlier. In addition, 
            operations teams that now are advising the development 
            teams get advance knowledge and experience to better 
            prepare and tune the production environment, 
            resulting in far more stable releases into production. 
            This supports the overall DevOps goals of faster development, 
            deployment and updates.
