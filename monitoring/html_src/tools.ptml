                  Zabbix is an open source network monitoring tool that
                  works with a centralized Linux-based Zabbix server.
                  The Zabbix server automatically collects and parses data
                  from
                  monitored hardware so administrators can check
                  availability and see trends in network performance.
                  The server communicates to the native software agents that
                  are available for many operating systems, including Linux,
                  UNIX and Windows. For operating systems without an agent,
                  generic monitoring protocols such as Simple Network
                  Management Protocol (SNMP) or Intelligent Platform
                  Management Interface (IPMI) can be used.
