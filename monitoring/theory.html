        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	Applications now are more business critical than ever. DevOps has brought automation to every stage of the application lifecycle which has significantly increased the speed from development to QA to production. Now there are frequent code commits with developers having to write comprehensive automated tests for their code. Every time a new commit occurs it automatically triggers all the unit and integration tests. Because development is striving more to use a production-like environment, monitoring becomes important. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
			Monitoring provides feedback about the application’s performance and usage patterns. This ensures the health and the availability of our IT systems and services. Effective monitoring is essential to allow DevOps teams to deliver at speed, get feedback from production, and increase customers satisfaction, acquisition and retention.

		<br />

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			<font color = "pink">Fault Detection:</font> The primary goal of monitoring is to determine when a resource becomes unavailable or starts to perform poorly. As soon as performance and other issues arise rich diagnostic data is sent back to the development teams.  This is the time to detect(TTD). TTM is the time to mitigate these issues by the DevOps teams. The time taken to mitigate the issues are measured and are improved on. After mitigation, teams work on finding the root cause of the issue so that they do not occur again. This is the time to remediate(TTR).
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<font color="pink">Validated Learning:</font> A second goal is validated learning by tracking usage. Every deployment is an opportunity to track experimental results that support or diminish the hypotheses that led to the deployment. Tracking usage and differences between versions allows teams to measure the impact of change and drive business decisions. If a hypothesis is diminished, the team can “fail fast” or “pivot”. If the hypothesis is supported, then the team can double down or “persevere”. These data-informed decisions lead to new hypotheses and prioritisation of the backlog.

        <p> <font color = "cyan"> What is APM ? </p> </font>
        <br/>
        <p>
	        APM stands for application performance management. APM are solutions that continuously monitor applications in production environments. They let you monitor user experience and improve the stability of the application infrastructure. It helps to identify the root cause of issues quickly to proactively prevent outages and keep users satisfied. By running APM solutions earlier in the life cycle, development teams get feedback in advance of how applications will eventually perform in production and can take corrective action much earlier. In addition, operations teams that now are advising the development teams get advance knowledge and experience to better prepare and tune the production environment, resulting in far more stable releases into production. This supports the overall DevOps goals of faster development, deployment and updates.
