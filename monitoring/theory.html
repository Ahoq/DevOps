        	Applications now are more business critical than ever. DevOps has brought automation to every stage of the application lifecycle which has significantly increased the speed from development to QA to production. Now there are frequent code commits with developers having to write comprehensive automated tests for their code. Every time a new commit occurs it automatically triggers all the unit and integration tests.
