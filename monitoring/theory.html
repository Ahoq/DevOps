        	Applications now are more business critical than ever. DevOps has brought automation to every stage of the application lifecycle which has significantly increased the speed from development to QA to production. Now there are frequent code commits with developers having to write comprehensive automated tests for their code. Every time a new commit occurs it automatically triggers all the unit and integration tests. Because development is striving more to use a production-like environment, monitoring becomes important.

			Monitoring provides feedback about the applicationâ€™s performance and usage patterns. This ensures the health and the availability of our IT systems and services.

			<font color = "pink">Fault Detection:</font> The primary goal of monitoring is to determine when a resource becomes unavailable or starts to perform poorly. As soon as performance and other issues arise rich diagnostic data is sent back to the development teams.  This is the time to detect(TTD). TTM is the time to mitigate these issues by the DevOps teams. The time taken to mitigate the issues are measured and are improved on. After mitigation, teams work on finding the root cause of the issue so that they do not occur again. This is the time to remediate(TTR).
