			Rationalism in software engineering
        </h1>

        <p>
        So, I've now come full circle, back to software engineering, after detouring
        through studying rationalism in

        planning</a>. And I have realized that long ago I had recognized the
        rationalist mistake in my own field of software engineering. It was present in
        the words of the critics of UNIX for not being designed according to some
        grand, theoretical blueprint, and instead being "hacked" together to fit the
        needs of the Bell Labs researchers. But even more so, it was present in the
        waterfall modelers and software managers requiring "complete specifications"
        before any coding starts.

        One goal of this effort was to be able
        to hire really dumb programmers, whom one could pay very little. As T.S. Eliot
        might have put it, "They were dreaming of systems so perfect that no one had to
        be intelligent." But the dream is generally impossible to achieve:
		it was like the Soviet Union's 
        <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union">five-year
        plans </a>that would envision all economic contingencies in advance, just that
        waterfall development was on a smaller scale. (Note: if the scale is small
        enough, or if one gets really lucky, or, most especially, if there is really
        much greater flexibility down the road than the method strictly allows,
        waterfall development can occasionally work. And that gave the method its
        plausibility.) The massive specification documents produced rapidly became
        worthless, because business conditions continually change, and people building
        and using software only learn what they really should be building or what they
        really want in the process of the building. (This is very similar to how market
        participants only

        </a>what consumers really want through the market process itself.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As Dwight Eisenhower said about battle plans:
        </p>
        
        <p>
        "I tell this story
        to illustrate the truth of the statement I heard long ago in the Army: Plans
        are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction
        because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one
        thing: the very definition of 'emergency' is that it is unexpected, therefore
        it is not going to happen the way you are planning." 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In other
        words, when we adopt Lean, Agile, and DevOps, we don't stop thinking about what
        we are going to build: we keep <i>planning</i>. We simply don't become attached
        to our <i>plans</i>: we recognize that we should be engaged in 
        <a
        href="https://lifehacker.com/get-better-at-getting-better-the-kaizen-productivity-p-1672205148">continuous
        learning</a> at every point in any software project. And that learning might
        entail modifying almost any aspect of the project, right up to the highest
        level specification document. After all, if our specification document assumed
        "the enemy" would be <i>in front</i> of our forces, but we suddenly find that
        

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae#Second_day">the
        enemy is behind us</a>, it would be sheer madness to continue on with our
        originally specified plan as if nothing had changed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The vast and
        growing suite of DevOps tools exists first and foremost to facilitate this way
        of working. And we should always keep that in mind as we implement various
        technical practices.
