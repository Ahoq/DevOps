        <i>Source:</i> Kanban, Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business by David J. Anderson <br>
        <i>Purpose of this page:</i> To understand the importance of kanban in DevOps and how to implement Kanban.

        DEFINTION:<br>
        Kan-ban is a Japanese word that literally means "signal card" in
        English. In a manufacturing environment, this card is used as a signal
        to tell an upstream step in a process to produce more. The workers at
        each step in the process are not allowed to do work unless they are
        signaled with a kanban from a downstream step.
        The signal to pull new work is inferred from visual quantitiy of work-in
        -progress subtracted from some indicator of the limit (or capacity).

        MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: <br>
        1. Visualize Workflow <br>
        2. Limit Work-in-Progress <br>
        3. Measure and Manage Flow <br>
        4. Make Process Policies Explicit <br>
        5. Use Models to Recognize Improvement Opportunities <br>

        Why should we use Kanban? <br>
        1. Focus on Quality <br>
        2. Reduce Work-in-Progress <br>
        3. Deliver Often <br>
        4. Balance Demand against Throughput <br>
        5. Prioritize <br>
        6. Attack Sources of Variability to Improve Predictability <br>
