        <b>Definition:</b><br>
        Kan-ban is a Japanese word that literally means "signal card" in
        English. In a manufacturing environment, this card is used as a signal
        to tell an upstream step in a process to produce more. The workers at
        each step in the process are not allowed to do work unless they are
        signaled with a kanban from a downstream step.
        The signal to pull new work is inferred from visual quantitiy of
        work-in-progress subtracted from some indicator of the
        limit (or capacity).

        <ol>
          <li>
            Decide the outer boundaries of the kanban system.  It is often best
            to limit this to the immediate span of political control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model the card wall to align with the boundary decision made
            regarding limiting WIP and visualizing work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define work types and model how their work flows.  Some types of
            work may require every step in the flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design the work item card to have enough information to faciliate
            self organization for pull and to enable team members to make good
            quality decisions with respect to risk based on work item type,
            service-level agreements, and classes of service.

            Use an electronic tracking tool if the team is distributed. <br>
            Examples of electronic tracking tools are Lean Kit Kanban,
            Agile Zen, Target Process, Silver Catalyst, RadTrack, Kanbanery,
            VersionOne, Greenhopper for Jira and Flow.io.

          <li>
            Discuss methods for handling concurrency in
            activites and choose how to model and visualize them
          </li>
          <li>
            Discuss methods for handling activites that do not need to follow a
            specifially ordered flow and choose how to model and visualize
            them.

            Daily standup meetings should be used to discuss issues,

            Daily standups also encourage a culture of continous development.
