                        <h2> If Slack and Google Docs had a baby, this would be it. This makes every part of your design work searchable, gives your team visual version control, and integrates with all of your other tools (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive). The best part? Comments from Slack, meetings, and emails are automatically attached to your designs. This is a design collaboration tool at its best. <br><br>
