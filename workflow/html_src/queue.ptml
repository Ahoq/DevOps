              <h1> Usage and Importance of Queue in Kanban</h1>
              <p>
                <b><i>Purpose of this page:</i></b> To understand the importance of Queue in
                Kanban and how to implement Queue in Kanban.
              </p>
              <br>


            <p>
              <b>Why Queue:</b> <br>
              Not only delivering quality code but also delivering it at
              'regualar' intervals is very important.  The manager along with
              his team should decide on how many days/weeks should that
              interval / cycle be. <br>
              Queue can be implemented in various ways in kanban. <br>
              1. We can divide the development in 2 columns into
              'implementation' column and 'ready to test' column.  This 'ready
              to test' column will act as a queue for test column. <br>
              2. We can divide our wishlist in 2 columns into 'wishlist'
              and 'queue'.  We should implement all the features in the queue
              before taking in the features from wishlist which can be done
              only when the new cycle starts.

            <p> We try to pull some features wishlist and transfer them into
              queue which can be completed in 1 cycle.

            <p>During the implementation of the cycle, we will not be able to
              pull anymore features or requests from wishlist, we will only work
              on the features in the queue. <br>
              Any new requests or features will be thrown into wishlist.
