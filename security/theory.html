          <h2>
            SQL Injection
         </h2>
        <p>
          A SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL
          query via the input data from the client to the application. A
          successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the
          database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute
          administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the
          DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file
          system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL
          injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL
          commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the
          execution of predefined SQL commands.

          <h2>
            Corss-Site Scripting (XSS)
         </h2>
        <p>
          Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
          malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web
          sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
          send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script,
          to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed
          are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input
          from a user within the output it generates without validating or
          encoding it.
  An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.
  The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be
  trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from
  a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session
  tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with
  that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

          <h2>
            Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
         </h2>
        <p>
          Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end
          user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which
          they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target
          state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no
          way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of
          social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an
          attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing
          actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a
          successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing
          requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and
          so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can
          compromise the entire web application.

          <h2>
            Command Injection
         </h2>
        <p>
          Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of
          arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable
          application. Command injection attacks are possible when an
          application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP
          headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the
          attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with
          the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection
          attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.
        </p>

          <h2>
            Web Shell
         </h2>
        <p>
          A web shell is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to
          enable remote administration of the machine. Infected web servers can
          be either Internet-facing or internal to the network, where the web
          shell is used to pivot further to internal hosts.
        </p>

          <h2>
            Path Traversal
         </h2>
        <p>
          A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to
          access files and directories that are stored outside the web root
          folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with
          “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using
          absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and
          directories stored on file system including application source code
          or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that
          access to files is limited by system operational access control (such
          as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows
          operating system).
