                  A SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL
                  query via the input data from the client to the application. A
                  successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the
                  database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute
                  administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the
                  DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file
                  system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL
                  injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL
                  commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the
                  execution of predefined SQL commands.

                    malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web
                    sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
                    send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script,
                    to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed
                    are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input

                    An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an
                    unsuspecting user.
                    The end user’s browser has no way to know that
                    the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script.
                    Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the
                    malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other
                    sensitive information retained by the browser and used with
                    that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

              <li>
                Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end
                user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which
                they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target
                state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no
                way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of
                social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an
                attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing
                actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a
                successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing
                requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and
                so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can
                compromise the entire web application.

                Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of
                arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable
                application. Command injection attacks are possible when an
                application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP
                headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the
                attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with
                the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection
                attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

                directories stored on file system including application source code
                or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that
                access to files is limited by system operational access control (such

                operating system).

                Web based application security has become an essential elements for almost
                every web application developed today reason being they are the favorite targets
                among attackers. For all concerned, the stakes are high: for businesses that derive
                increasing revenue from Internet commerce, for users who trust web applications with
                sensitive information, and for criminals who can make big money by stealing payment
                details or compromising bank accounts. Reputation plays a critical role. Few people
                want to do business with an insecure website, so few organizations want to disclose
                details about their own security vulnerabilities or breaches. Hence, it is not a
                trivial task to obtain reliable information about the state of web application
                security today.

                With evolution of technology, web applications have brought with them a new range
                of security vulnerabilities. The set of most commonly encountered defects has
                also evolved somewhat over time. New attacks have been conceived that were not
                considered when existing applications were developed. Some problems have become
                less prevalent as awareness of them has increased. New technologies have been
                developed that have introduced new possibilities for exploitation. Some
                categories of flaws have largely gone away as the result of changes made to
                web browser software.

                The most serious attacks against web applications are those that expose
                sensitive data or gain unrestricted access to the back-end systems on which
                 the application is running. High-profile compromises of this kind continue
                 to occur frequently. For many organizations, however, any attack that causes
                  system downtime is a critical event. Application-level denial-of-service
                  attacks can be used to achieve the same results as traditional resource
                  exhaustion attacks against infrastructure. However, they are often used
                  with more subtle techniques and objectives. They may be used to disrupt
                  a particular user or service to gain a competitive edge against peers in
                  the realms of financial trad- ing, gaming, online bidding, and ticket
                  reservations.

                Throughout this evolution, compromises of prominent web applications have
                remained prevalent. There is no sense that a corner has been turned and that
                these security problems are on the wane. By some measure, web application
                security is today the most significant battleground between attackers and
                those with computer resources and data to defend.

                Below figures are the most commomly categoriesd vulnerability of web based
                application found during testing in 2007 and 2011:

                 Broken authentication (62%) —This category of vulnerability encom- passes
                 various defects within the application’s login mechanism, which may enable
                 an attacker to guess weak passwords, launch a brute-force attack, or bypass
                 the login.

                 Broken access controls (71%)  — This involves cases where the application
                 fails to properly protect access to its data and functionality, potentially
                 enabling an attacker to view other users’ sensitive data held on the server
                 or carry out privileged actions.

                 SQL injection (32%) — This vulnerability enables an attacker to submit
                 crafted input to interfere with the application’s interaction with back-end
                 databases. An attacker may be able to retrieve arbitrary data from the application,
                 interfere with its logic, or execute commands on the database server itself.

                 Cross-site scripting (94%) — This vulnerability enables an attacker to target
                 other users of the application, potentially gaining access to their data,
                 performing unauthorized actions on their behalf, or carrying out other
                 attacks against them.

                 Information leakage (78%) — This involves cases where an application divulges
                  sensitive information that is of use to an attacker in developing an assault
                  against the application, through defective error handling or other behavior.

                Cross-site request forgery (92%) — This flaw means that application users
                can be induced to perform unintended actions on the application within their
                 user context and privilege level. The vulnerability allows a malicious web site
                 visited by the victim user to interact with the applica- tion to perform actions
                 that the user did not intend.
