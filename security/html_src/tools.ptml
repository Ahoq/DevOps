            Security Tools Comparison
        </h1>

        <p align="justify">
            Several automated tools are available that scan web applications 
            to look for known security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site 
            scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and 
            insecure server configuration. These scans are usually done from 
            the outside. Scanning using such tools are usually the first step 
            in any vulnerability analysis. This phase is commonly referred as 
            Dynamic Application Security Testing, where the application is 
            tested in its operating state. 
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Dynamic Application Security Testing can be combined with Static 
            Application Security Testing (SAST), which invloves source code 
            testing to find out vulnerabilites in design and construction 
            flaws. Together, DAST and SAST look at both sides of an 
            application  to prune out potential vulnerabilities.
