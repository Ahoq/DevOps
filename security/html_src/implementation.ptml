                    We are responible for the security of the DevOps Project. We have used the best security industry practices and ensure every other team to be in compliance with that.


                     Initially, We started  understanding the system, its component and interactions between them. We spent a good amount of time to holistically analyse the system to find various threat vectors. Our focus was to build a robust and secure infrastructure and hence we scope the Web-application and Network infrastcture for our security testing.
