                        An introduction to DevSecOps or rugged DevOps

                        Rugged DevOps is the practice of shifting Security left. 
                        Security teams can introduce security much earlier in the 
                        development process. This is contrary to the standard 
                        approach where security practices of code analysis and 
                        vulnerability testing is placed just before the 
                        application is deployed into production.

                        Introducing security practices earlier in the software 
                        engineering will enable developers to always think of 
                        security while developing their application. This will 
                        also enable them to come up with creative solutions for 
                        enabling security in their applications.

                        DevOps provides a method to have the concept of "Security 
                        by Design" integrated into the software engineering 
                        lifecycle from the start. It also helps keep security 
                        balanced with business objectives.
