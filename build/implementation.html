            Building and Git Submodules
        </h2>

        <p>
            We rely on git submodules in several areas of our 
            <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/AgileCourseware/index.html">agile courseware</a> program.
            But this dependence can be tricky: while git supports submodules,
            it often does not seem to "like" doing so! Here we will write up
            some problems we've hit in that area.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first thing we are going to document is how to setup your 
            clone of an existing submodule. 
            <br />
            Here is a screenshot of that step:
