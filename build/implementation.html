            Building and Git Submodules
        </h2>

        <p>
            We rely on git submodules in several areas of our 
            <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/AgileCourseware/index.html">agile courseware</a> program.
            But this dependence can be tricky: while git supports submodules,
            it often does not seem to "like" doing so! Here we will write up
            some problems we've hit in that area.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first thing we are going to document is how to clone from a repository.
            We need to open our terminal and cd into the file we want to clone our repository in. Once we have done that
            <!-- In the screenshot shown below we have have cd into a directory called clone which is located on my Desktop. -->
			we run the following command:<br/>
            <code>
        	git clone https://github.com/gcallah/DevOps.git
        	</code>
        	<br/>
            (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the GitHub webpage shown below in the second screenshot.)

        <p>
            If you need to add a submodule whether for first time or again, 
            it is actually easier than some of the online document that suggest.
            For instance, to add TheDevOpsCourse to DevOps, you would just 
            run:
            <br/>
        <p>
            <code>
            git submodule add https://github.com/gcallah/TheDevOpsCourse.git
            </code>
            <br/>
            (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the GitHub webpage.)
            <br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes a submodule can be corrupted and will have to be removed. This process is difficult !
