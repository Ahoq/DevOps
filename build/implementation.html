                Building and Git Submodules
            </summary>
    
            <p>
                We rely on git submodules in several areas of our 
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/AgileCourseware/index.html">agile courseware</a> program.
                But this dependence can be tricky: while git supports submodules,
                it often does not seem to "like" doing so! Here we will write up
                some problems we've hit in that area.
            </p>

                The first thing we are going to document is how to clone from a
                repository.
                We need to open our terminal and cd into the file we want to clone
                our repository in. Once we have done that
                <!-- In the screenshot shown below we have have cd into a
                    directory called clone which is located on my Desktop. -->
    			we run the following command:<br/>
                <code>
            	git clone https://github.com/gcallah/DevOps.git
            	</code>
            	<br/>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the GitHub
                webpage shown below in the second screenshot.)

            <p>
                If you need to add a submodule whether for first time or again, 
                it is actually easier than some of the online document that suggest.
                For instance, to add TheDevOpsCourse to DevOps, you would just 
                run:
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <code>
                git submodule add https://github.com/gcallah/TheDevOpsCourse.git
                </code>
                <br/>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the
                GitHub webpage.)
                <br/>
            </p>
    
            <figure>

            <p>
                Sometimes a submodule can be corrupted and will have to be removed.
                This process is difficult !
