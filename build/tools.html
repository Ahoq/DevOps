            Build Tools Comparison
        </h1>

        <p>
            A "Build tool" is a single term that refers to anything that is needed
             to get a piece of software set up, but isn't needed after that. There 
             are numerous number of build tools each having a different set of 
             tradeoffs associated with them. Here are some of the major build tools 
             and their features:

                Make - Make was first created in 1976, but the variants of this build 
                tool are still going strong in todayâ€™s world of system development. In 
                make we have to specify dependency followed by a rule to resolve those 
                dependencies. It is a powerful product oriented tool which is highly capable
                of tracking dependencies within a build and building only those parts/components
                that have been updated/changed. Thus helping in optimizing performance whereby
                compilation time is crucial in development cycles. The drawback of this
                tool is that with increase in the rise of complexity, the number of dependency
                between their component also increases causing the rules even more complex 
                making it really hard to debug. To make things better for this drawback we
                regularly see teams making a MakeFile in each sub-directory and a top level 
                MakeFile. The top level MakeFile recursively runs the subdirectories 
                resulting in the build information and processes to spread over many files.
                The other drawbacks of this tool is that due to significant amount of
                whitespaces it makes it susceptible to hard-to-find class of bugs.
                Make are aksi OS specific. Many people have started using SCons instead of Make.

                Maven - 
            </li>

            <li>
                Ant - Ant is a Task oriented build tool which was first released in 2000. The 
                limitations found in Make tool led to the Java Community to experiment different
                solutions such as porting Make to Java. At this same time XML was coming up into 
                prominence as a build tool. Combining the power of both these approaches led to 
                the Apache Ant build tool. Being fully cross platform , a set of instructions 
                are writted in Java to basic operations like compilation and file manipulation. 
                Besides being cross-platform it is also an extremely flexible and powerful system,
                with Ant Tasks for most things we want to do. Despite of being powerful, 
                it comes with certain drawbacks namely the build scripts have to be written 
                in XML (not quite pleasant for human readability), a lot of time has to be spent
                in performing tasks (writing boiler plate to compile, create jars, run tests etc)
                due to lack of a real domain concept. Ant files are poorly factored and tend to
                get really long, it wont be surprising if we see thousands of lines long.
