                Building and Git Submodules
            </summary>
    
            <p>
                We rely on git submodules in several areas of our 
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/AgileCourseware/index.html">agile courseware</a> program.
                But this dependence can be tricky: while git supports 
                submodules,it often does not seem to "like" doing so! Here we 
                will write up some problems we've hit in that area.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first thing we are going to document is how to clone from a
                repository.
                We need to open our terminal and cd into the file we want to 
                clone our repository in. Once we have done that
                we run the following command:<br/>
                <code>
                git clone https://github.com/gcallah/DevOps.git
                </code>
                <br/>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the 
                GitHub webpage shown below in the second screenshot.)

            <p>
                If you need to add a submodule whether for first time or again,
                it is actually easier than some of the online document that 
                suggest.For instance, to add TheDevOpsCourse to DevOps, you 
                would just run:
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <code>
                git submodule add https://github.com/gcallah/TheDevOpsCourse.git
                </code>
                <br/>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the
                GitHub webpage.)
                <br/>
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
                Sometimes a submodule can be corrupted and will have to be 
                removed. This process is difficult !

        <li><p>How to install Command Line Tool on Mac OS X ?</p>
        <p>The steps listed below will guide you through the process of 
           installing command line tool on Mac OS X</p>
            <ol type = "1" class="nested">
                <li> Launch terminal which can be found in /Applications/Utilities</li>
                <li> Type the following command:<br><br>
                    <code>xcode-select --install</code><br><br>
                    Terminal will display the following if you haven't 
                    downloaded it before:<br><br>
                    <code> x-code select: note: install requested for command 
                    line developer tools </code><br><br>
                    However if you have downloaded it before then you will get
                    the following message:<br><br>
                    <code> xcode-select: error: command line tools are already
                    installed, use "Software Update" to install updates</code>
                </li>
                <li> A simple software update pop up will prompt you to select
                     one of the three options.Options are Get Xcode, Not now 
                     and Install. Get Xcode will install both Xcode and the 
                     command line developer tools from the App Store. Not 
                     now will quit the installation process. Install will lead
                     to installation of the command line tool once you have 
                     accepted the "Terms of Service".</li>
                <li> The Command Line Tools package may take upto several 
                     minutes to download based on your connection speed.</li>
                <li> The installer goes ahead smoothly and completes on its own
                    . You can confirm everything is working as expected by 
                     trying out the commands like gcc, git, svn, rebase, make,
                     ld, otool, nm. </li>
                <li> The command line toolkit package can be found in the following directory:<br><br>
                     <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ </code></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p>python 3</p>
            <p> Put a symbolic link called ‘python3’ in the directory where you
             have python: now running ‘python3’ should work. *But* make sure it
             points to some python 3 version, and not 2.7</p>

            <li><p> Cannot build website</p>
                <p>You must run that from the "main" DevOps directory, not your
                 team subdirectory. If you only have Python 2.7… time 
                 to upgrade!</p>
