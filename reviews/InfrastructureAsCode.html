            The author of this book understands the hassle that infrastructure engineers face on daily basis from his experience with many teams and aims to provide insight
            for the readers to comprehend infrastructure issues and free the engineers of their drudgery from such intricacies.

              Chapter 1: Challenges and Principles
            </summary>
            <p>
                The first chapter explains about what Infrastructure as Code means to the readers and the goals that Infrastructure as a Code intends to achieve. The automation fear
                spiral is one thing that engineers have to consider if they wish to automate the work with minimum hassle. The chapter then delves into the principles of
                Infrastructure as code, introducing us to the principles with examples where they are necesary.

              Chapter 2: Dynamic Infrastructure Platforms
            </summary>
            <p>
                In this chapter the author talks about what dynamic infrastructure is and the different types of dynamic infrastructure platforms like Public Iaas, Community Iaas Cloud,
                private Iaas and bare-metal cloud. Implementing dynamic infrastructure as per the company requirements is the heart of topic and the process you follow to achieve it marks
                the essence of the topic. The chapter then explains the three important building blocks of Infrastructure platform: Compute, Storage and Networking and how the make up
                cloud infrastructure. It also provides examples on how the different types of clouds : IaaS,PaaS and SaaS work. The chapter basically prepares the us on the theoretical
                aspects of the dynamic infrastructure by case studies and examples and leads the path for implementation of it in the next chapter.

              Chapter 3: Infrastructure Definition Tools
            </summary>
            <p>
                The chapter describes infrastructure tools(Eg: TerraForm, Cloud Formation etc.) for managing resources following the principles mentioned in the previous chapter.
                Many automation tools do not follow the principles mentioned here but they get the work done in real world following these principles in one or the other way. The first
                part of the chapter deals with Command Line Interface(CLI) Tools and how the tools could be configured and writen using the scripts and their interdependency.
                According to the book the scripts should follow the properties of Idempotency, Pre-checks, Post-checks, Visible failure and parameterized and it discusses how
                these properties make scripts more reliable. The next half of the chapter deals with using VCS tools to configure resources for a particular infrastructure and
                handles cases such as configuring files, users etc. Overall it describes how resources could be carefully and successfully allocated so that they work perfectly
                in the given enviroment.

              Chapter 4: Server Configuration Tools
            </summary>
            <p>
                This chapter explains how different tools such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible and other tools are used to configure the server so that automation works in a new level
                compared to using scripts. The author delineates the goals for Automated server management. He gives some insight on "Tools for creating servers",
                "Tools for configuring servers", "Tools for packaging server templates", "Tools for running commands on Servers etc.". The tools such as Docker are being widely
                used these days and are refereed to as containerization tools. In the last part of the book the author explains the advantages of using containerzation tools vs
                virtual machines and discusses how to use them securely.

              Chapter 5: General Infrastructure Services
            </summary>
            <p>
              Until now, the author has described about configuring, provisioning of infrastructure resources but in real world scenario the infrastructure needs number of other
              tools to support it and this chapter delineates general set of such tools.
              The preference of such tools is based on factors such as external configuration, how dynamic the tools are and how easy it to obtain cloud-compatible license.
              Sharing a service across the team or company is one of the important factors and author substantiates this with an example here. He then discusses about the
              Monitoring and what goals should it achieve, importance of Logging, deployment and packaging of the software etc.
