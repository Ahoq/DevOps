               The Use of Knowledge in Society

                Authors: F.A. Hayek

                The author first suppose a question: What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order? 
                It is so complicated for a single person to explain and the solution would not merely "given" by society as a totality.
                <br />
                On the contrary,  all individuals in our society poessess some part of the answer to this question. The author believes that there may not have a simple, mathematics logic to explain "why it happens," but he could say, as an individual, the diverse paths of reasoning have converged, because of their vision.

                Anyway, there must be someone need to decide what the whole system should do. We call that process: planning. Usually, planning means "central planning" - direction of the whole system according to one unified plan. And the other side of central planning is competition, a decentralized planning process. These two process decide the organization of modern industries and companies.

                <br />
                So the first problem is merely shifting the difficulty to the problem of selecting the experts which have a suitable position and appropriate aspects of knowledge(mostly scientific knowledge these days). Though we find those experts, it is only a small part of the wide problem.
                Except scientific knowledge, there is some knowledge that could not conclude as "scientific": the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. This kind of knowledge is possessed not only the experts but also almost everyone, because it base on special experience of circumstances of some moments that not known to others. 
                It comes back to response the idea of last chapter: each one hold some knowledge of the "truth", they may not even realized it is valuable. Furthermore, I think find someone to gather those knowledge is a better way to find someone to make a big plan and aollocate detail tasks to those people to use their knowledge. It may delay the time of planning, but it would make the whole system more balance. There won't be a head of eastern dragon with a body of western dragon.
                There is another method to solve this problem is, well, sharing. If all people have those required knowledge before they get to work, this problem is solved naturely. But the author mentioned that this method is precisely what we have to find an answer. (So that's why we have education. :)
