                The author first suppose a question: What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational economic order? 
                It is so complicated for a single person to explain and the solution would not merely "given" by society as a totality.
                <br />
                On the contrary,  all individuals in our society poessess some part of the answer to this question. The author believes that there may not have a simple, mathematics logic to explain "why it happens," but he could say, as an individual, the diverse paths of reasoning have converged, because of their vision.

                Anyway, there must be someone need to decide what the whole system should do. We call that process: planning. Usually, planning means "central planning" - direction of the whole system according to one unified plan. And the other side of central planning is competition, a decentralized planning process. These two process decide the organization of modern industries and companies.
