        <b>What is monitoring?</b><br>
        From a technological perspective, monitoring is the tools and
        processes by which you measure and manage your IT systems.
        Monitoring is something that provides the translation between business
        value and the metrics generated by your systems and applications.
        These metrics can be translated into measurable user experience, which
        in turn provides feedback to the business to help ensure the delivery
        of customers requirements. It also gives feedback on insufficient or
        nonworking services. <br>
        Monitoring system has two customers :
        (1) The business (2) Information Technology <br>
        The stages of a three-level maturity model reflecting
        monitoring evolution are :<br>
        <b>(i) Manual : </b> In this stage , monitoring is largely manual, user initiated,
        or not done at all.<br>
        <b>(ii) Reactive : </b> This type of monitoring is mostly automatic
        with some remnants of manual or unmonitored components.<br>
        <b>(iii) Proactive : </b>Here, monitoring is automatic and generated
        by configuration management. Example of different monitoring tools
        are Nagios, Sensu, and Graphite.<br/>

      <p>
      This chapter proposes an architecture for a monitoring framework. 
      This new architecture is based on "whitebox" or push based monitoring 
      rather than a "blackbox" or pull based monitoring. In a white box or 
      push based monitoring the components being monitored are queried. But 
      in a "blackbox" or pull based monitoring the components being monitored
      send their data to a central collector.
