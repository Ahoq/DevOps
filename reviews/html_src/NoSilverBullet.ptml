        <p>
            When it comes to software developing, people are always 
            getting into some troubles, such as missed schedules, 
            blown budgets, and flawed products, 
            which make developing work very painful.
            People are desperate to find a silver bullet 
            (an ultimate solution) for those problems.
            However, when we look back at the past decade, 
            we see no silver bullet.        
        </p>
        <p>
            This article is trying to tell us why 
            there is still no silver bullet, 
            past breakthroughs against those issues 
            and future hope for the silver 
            (potential ultimate solutions).

            Essential Difficulties

            The author clarifies that it is relatively slow 
            pace of software progress is normal. 
            The rapid development of computer hardware is extremly 
            unique throughout the entire human history. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most difficult parts, such as specification, design
            and testing of conceptual construct, are fuzzy, which
            makes software hard inherently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author concludes 4 main properties of the 
            essential difficulties : complexity, conformity, 
            changeability, and invisibility.
