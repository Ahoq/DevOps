            What is this article about?
        </h4>
        <p>
            When it comes to software developing, people are always 
            getting into some troubles, such as missed schedules, 
            blown budgets, and flawed products, 
            which make developing work very painful.
            People are desperate to find a silver bullet 
            (an ultimate solution) for those problems.
            However, when we look back at the past decade, 
            we see no silver bullet.        
        </p>
        <p>
            This article is trying to tell us why 
            there is still no silver bullet, 
            past breakthroughs against those issues 
            and future hope for the silver 
            (potential ultimate solutions).

        <h4>
            Essential Difficulties
        </h4>
        <p>
            The author clarifies that the relatively slow 
            pace of software progress is normal. 
            The rapid development of computer hardware is extremly 
            unique throughout the entire human history. 
            Comparison between progresses of software and hardware is 
            neither fair nor reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most difficult parts, such as specification, design
            and testing of conceptual construct, are fuzzy, which
            makes software hard inherently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author concludes 4 main properties of the 
            essential difficulties : complexity, conformity, 
            changeability, and invisibility.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Complexity</b> - The Software itself 
                    is more complex than other
                    human construct. And since software systems have 
                    more states than computers do, their complexity 
                    would increase much more than linearly. 
                    Unlike mathematics and the physical sciences, the complexities
                    are the essential properties of software development, which is
                    one of the reason why it is almost impossible to abstract certain
                    essence to simplicify problems we faced during software developing.
                    Both technical problems and management problems count when we try
                    to overview and control all loose ends.

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Conformity</b> - Conformation to other complex interfaces
                    is a must for the software. And many complexities come from
                    those conformations, which can not be avoided.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Changeability</b> - Software is infinitely malleable. Unlike
                    buildings, cars and computers, software changes are
                    not that expansive and hard. Software is highly related to 
                    applications, users, laws, and machine vehicles. Their changes will
                    force software to change.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Invisibility</b> - Software has no ready geometric 
                    representation, which impedes the process of design within
                    one mind and severely hinders communication among minds.
