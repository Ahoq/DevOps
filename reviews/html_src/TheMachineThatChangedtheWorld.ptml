            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>

          When The Machine That Changed the World
          was first published in 1990,
          Toyota was half the size of General Motors.
          Today Toyota is passing GM as the world's
          largest auto maker and is the most consistently
          successful global enterprise of the past
          fifty years. This management classic
          was the first book to reveal Toyota's
          lean production system that is
          the basis for its enduring success.

        <p>
          Now reissued with a new Foreword
          and Afterword, Machine contrasts
          two fundamentally different business
          systems -- lean versus mass, two very
          different ways of thinking about how
          humans work together to create value.
          Based on the largest and most thorough
          study ever undertaken of any
          industry -- MIT's five-year,
          fourteen-country International Motor
          Vehicle Program -- this book describes t
          he entire managerial system of
          lean production.
        </p>
        <p>
           Nearly twenty years ago, Womack, Jones,
           and Roos provided a comprehensive
           description of the entire
           lean system. They exhaustively documented
           its advantages over the mass production
           model pioneered by General Motors
           and predicted that lean production would
           eventually triumph. Indeed, they argued
           that it would triumph
           not just in manufacturing but in every
           value-creating activity
           from health care to retail to distribution.

          Chapter 1 - The Industry of Industries in Transition
        </h2>

        <p>
          This chapter talks about how Toyota surpassed
          GM as the largest automaker due to implementing
          the practice of lean production.
          This chapter gives a brief idea about
          the differences between craft
          production, mass production and lean production.
          Craft Production: Makes use of highly skilled
          workers to create custom goods which are
          expensive and are of high quality.
          Mass Production: Makes use of semi-skilled
          workers to produce same kind of product in
          large quantity. This production technique
          requires a large space, large number of
          workers and is quite inflexible.
          Lean Production: Everything is
          less compared to mass production
          technique. Makes use of half the
          space, workers, time, investment in tools
          and the time to develop the product by using
          skilled workers and pushing responsibility
          down the organizational hierarchy.
