                This chapter provides a quick introduction to Kubernetes with 
                its several benefits. Kubernetes is an open source tool for 
                deploying containerized applications and can be used to deploy 
                scalable, reliable distributed systems. It provides benefits 
                like velocity, scaling, abstraction of infrastructure and 
                efficiency. The authors also describe how these benefits are 
                easily achieved by using Kubernetes for deployment.

                    Chapter 2: Creating and Running Containers
                </summary>
                <p>
                This chapter starts by discussing the problems that occur in
                distributed system such as applications having dependency on
                shared library or any dependency on asset files which causes
                failures or complexities when deployed in production. Then the
                solution for these problems are discussed which involve using 
                container immutable images for deploying the application. 
                Docker is the most popular container image that can package an 
                application and is supported by Kubernetes. The authors then 
                discuss how to package an application into Docker image, 
                security related considerations to keep in mind while building
                images and how to optimize image sizes. The authors recommend
                storing images in remote repository and describe its benefits.
                Then they discuss how to start running the application using
                docker image, how to limit resource utilization while running
                and in the end how to clean up docker images.
