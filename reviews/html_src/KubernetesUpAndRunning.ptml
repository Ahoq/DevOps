                This chapter provides a quick introduction to Kubernetes with 
                its several benefits. Kubernetes is an open source tool for 
                deploying containerized applications and can be used to deploy 
                scalable, reliable distributed systems. It provides benefits 
                like velocity, scaling, abstraction of infrastructure and 
                efficiency. The authors also describe how these benefits are 
                easily achieved by using Kubernetes for deployment.
