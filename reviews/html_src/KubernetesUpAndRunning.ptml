                <p>
                This chapter provides a quick introduction to Kubernetes with 
                its several benefits. Kubernetes is an open source tool for 
                deploying containerized applications and can be used to deploy 
                scalable, reliable distributed systems. It provides benefits 
                like velocity, scaling, abstraction of infrastructure and 
                efficiency. The authors also describe how these benefits are 
                easily achieved by using Kubernetes for deployment.

                </summary>
                <p>
                This chapter starts by discussing the problems that occur in
                distributed system such as applications having dependency on
                shared library or any dependency on asset files which causes
                failures or complexities when deployed in production. Then the
                solution for these problems are discussed which involve using 
                container immutable images for deploying the application. 
                Docker is the most popular container image that can package an 
                application and is supported by Kubernetes. The authors then 
                discuss how to package an application into Docker image, 
                security related considerations to keep in mind while building
                images and how to optimize image sizes. The authors recommend
                storing images in remote repository and describe its benefits.
                Then they discuss how to start running the application using
                docker image, how to limit resource utilization while running
                and in the end how to clean up docker images.

                </summary>
                <p>
                In this chapter steps for installing Kubernetes cluster are
                discussed. The steps for installing Kubernetes on 3 major
                cloud providers Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and
                Microsoft Azure is described. Then steps for deploying
                Kubernetes single node cluster on local machine using minikube
                is discussed. The commands using kubectl which is the
                Kubernetes client for exploring the cluster and verifying its
                health are described. At last, the Kubernetes cluster
                components like Kubernetes Proxy, Kubernetes DNS and
                Kubernetes UI and their role within the cluster is discussed.

                    Chapter 4: Common kubectl Commands
                </summary>
                <p>
                In this chapter, the authors dive into one of the command 
                line utilities of Kubernetes called, 'kubectl' which is 
                basically responsible for creating objects and interacting
                with kubernetes APIs. Then they briefly talk about namespaces
                for the organization of objects in a cluster, and to 
                permanently store the naming schema in the config file, 
                'context' is used. One of the important utility of kubectl 
                apart from the creation of API objects is viewing them. 
                Kubectl also enables users to create update and delete the 
                kubernetes objects. Also, it enables the commands for 
                debugging of the container and can execute the logs. 
                The authors have discussed the annotations and labels of 
                the objects as well, which has been discussed in details 
                in Chapter 6.

                    Chapter 6: Labels and Annotations
                </summary>
                <p>
                After explaining the core concept of Pods, the authors 
                immediately discuss the foundational concepts like Labels and 
                Annotations. Authors feel that Labels and Annotations are 
                often wrongly considered as the same concept and thus make a 
                great effort in explaining the difference and why it is 
                actually required to differentiate between the two. Authors 
                state that 'labels' are basically key-value pair and are 
                useful in attaching identifiable information to kubernetes 
                objects like Pods. Whereas, 'annotations' are storage 
                technique designed to hold unidentifiable information which 
                can be used by tools and libraries. The authors further 
                explain the application of labels and their modification 
                with help of commands and examples. Further, the authors 
                provide insight on annotation with detailed applicability.
