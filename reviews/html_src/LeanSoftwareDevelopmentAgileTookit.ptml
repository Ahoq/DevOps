            <p>
              This book aims to introduce the thinking tools for software
              development process to go agile. It functions aside
              a toolkit to help translate widely accepted lean principles
              into effective, agile practices that can be customized
              to individual software development domains. The author is
              trying to dig out the potential improvement for development
              process.
              <br />
              This book contains 22 thinking tools to help develop the agile
              practices that work best in all people's particular domains.
              These tools are summarized into 7 lean principals from which
              they are translated.
              <br />
              <ul class="nested">
                  <li>Eliminate waste</li>
                  <li>Amplify learning</li>
                  <li>Decide as late as possible</li>
                  <li>Deliver as fast as possible</li>
                  <li>Empower the team</li>
                  <li>Build integrity in</li>
                  <li>See the whole</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              These principles and its related toolkits are introduced in
              details one principle each chapter and provide
              practical suggestions for implementing the priciples and these
              toolkits. Very good book for managers, project managers and
              technical leaders.

                    Chapter 1: Eliminate Waste
                </summary>
                <p>
                  This concept, Eliminate waste, is first brought up by the
                  Taiichi Ohno, known as the father of the Toyota Production
                  System, to deal with the conflict of market requirement and
                  manufacture cost. In this concept, he gives waste a new
                  definition "anything that does not create value for a
                  customer is waste. A part that is sitting around waiting to
                  be used is waste. Making something that is not immediately
                  needed is waste. Motion is waste. Transportation is waste.
                  Waiting is waste. Any extra processing steps are waste.
                  And of course defects are waste"[1]. The core of his ideal is
                  that immediate production delivery is better than inventory.
                  The history has proven the validity of his idea and this
                  concept is becoming the most fundamental lean principles that
                  all other principles should follow from.
                  <br /><br />
                  So before everything else, to implement this principle, the
                  first step is learning to see waste. If a thing can't
                  contribute to customer's perception or there is a way to go
                  around it, it is waste. By this definition, Windston Royce had
                  seen all steps besides coding and analysis are waste to
                  development in 1970. The author metion this because it is a
                  good start to re-evalue steps in development waterfall
                  process. Then the auther translates the 7 wastes of
                  manufacturing identified by Shigeo into 7 corresponding wastes
                  in software development.
                  <br />
                  <table>
                    <tr>
                      <th>7 Wastes in Software Development</th>
                      <th>Cost</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                     <th>Partially Done Work</th>
                     <th>
                  Partially done work will not get in the way of other
                  development but also yields no valuable delivery and tie up
                  resources. It also gonna be a high risk in final production.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Extra Process</th>
                    <th>
                  Unnecessary paperwork are a mass extra cost to Development
                  process. Paperwork should be something eager to use and
                  need to transmit effective information.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Extra Features</th>
                    <th>
                  Extra features that seems harmless  would increase complexity
                  and tential failure point. Codes that not needed now should
                  be treated as waste.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Task Switching</th>
                    <th>
                    Assigning people multiple projects is a waste since the
                    switch among them would cost much time for developers
                    to switch their thoughts and may cause interruptions.
                    With same resource, projects should be done one by one.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Waiting</th>
                    <th>
                      Waiting is one of the biggest wastes that delys are very
                      common in software development. It keeps
                      customers from realizing value as soon as possible[1].
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Motion</th>
                    <th>
                      The process of motion could become waste in process, not
                      only the people, but also the artifact information. Team
                      work apart would cost time to communicate with each other.
                      Handoff document from group to group also would be the
                      source since it can't contain all creater's knowledge.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Defects</th>
                    <th>
                      Defect is a waste due to its impact and its undetected
                      period. The reduction can be improved by testing
                      immediately, integrating often and release as soon as
                      possible.
                    </th>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <br />
                <br />
                Although management, project tracking and control syste,
                authorization system would not directly add value to the
                production process, they are still very important because
                wastes mentioned above can be minimized by these systems.
