                <li>Too much work-in-progress (wip)</li>
                <li>Unknown Dependencies</li>

            Conclusion:
            Dominica starts by exposing the five time thieves and 
            detailing how they keep us busy and overcommited while 
            allowing critical work to fall by the wayside. It is in 
            this section that Dominica describes tech debt work (work 
            that has accumulated due to short cuts, deferred maintenence,
            the passage of time, or other point in time decisions) as 
            revenue protection. 

            For me, this was a criticial connection. In the DevOps 
            and Digital Transformation discussion, we look at how 
            we can relate our development and IT operations work to 
            customer value. What we often have a hard time voicing is 
            how to fit those tech debt tasks into that value stream. 
            When we look at it from a perspective of revenue protection, 
            (keeping services available, responsive, and secure helps 
            keep customers ya know..), it becomes evident that those 
            tasks need to be represented in the work we are doing.

            Another major takeaway for me was in the focus on the 
            metrics of the flow of work. Dominica dives in to a 
            variety of metrics that can be gleaned from using Kanban 
            and, more importantly, what those metrics mean for the 
            flow of work through the organization.
