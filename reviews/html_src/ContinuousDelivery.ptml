        This book describes an effective pattern for getting 
        software from development to release using the deployment 
        pipeline. A <i>deployment pipeline</i> is an automated 
        implementation of the applicationâ€™s build, deploy, test, 
        and release process. The deployment pipeline has several 
        benefits. It makes every part of the process of building, 
        deploying, testing, and releasing software visible to 
        everybody involved thus aiding <i>collaboration</i>. It 
        improves <i> feedback </i> so that problems are identified 
        and resolved as early in the process as possible. It also 
        enables teams to deploy and release any version of their 
        software to any environment at will through a <i> fully 
        automated process</i>.

        This book describes ways to <i> deliver high quality, 
        valuable software in an efficient, fast, and reliable manner
        </i>. To achieve low cycle time and high quality, frequent 
        and automated releases of the software are required.
        The techniques and principles described in this book can be 
        used on projects in both small and large organizations. 
        The techniques are aligned with the philosophy and ideas of 
        the lean movement. Such methods ensure the rapid delivery 
        of high quality products, focusing on the removal of waste 
        and the reduction of cost. <i> Lean practices result in 
        huge cost and resource savings, much higher quality 
        products, and faster time-to-market in several industries 
        </i>. This philosophy has become mainstream in the field of 
        software development. Lean is not limited in its 
        application to small systems. It was created and applied to 
        huge organizations, and even whole economies.
