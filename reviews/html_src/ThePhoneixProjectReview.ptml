<h3> 
  Chapter 1: 
</h3>
Our protagonist Bill Palmer is called to 
meet the CEO and worries that he may be getting fired. 
Instead he learns that the CIO and Chief of IT 
Operations(Luke and Damon) have been fired. 
After CEO Steve convinces Bill of the hard times 
the company is going through, Bill accepts the 
role of VP of Operations. He is already facing a new 
problem as Paychecks for company employees are stuck!

<h3> 
  Chapter 2: 
</h3>
Bill meets Dick and Ann who explain to him about 
the Payroll problem. There are only zeroes in salary 
column for hourly employees. One backup option is to 
pay everyone based on previous cycle but that will lead 
to overpaying or underpaying some employees inviting the 
Union to step in. Bill suggests working on plan B while he 
investigates further. On reaching IT dept., Wes and Patty 
tell him about the SAN(Storage Area Network) failure which 
everyone is trying to fix since all servers are down. Bill 
tries to relate payroll failure to SAN failure.
</p>
<p>
<h3>
  Chapter 3:
</h3>
The SAN failure was caused due to firmware upgrade. 
The upgrade was pending for a few years, taking a toll 
on system performance. On rebooting the SAN, self-tests 
started failing as they were written according to 
previous versions.

<br>
<br>
Here we see a classic example of lack of a 
ticketing system as well as absence of change 
authorization system!
<br>
The issue of payroll is identified to be an effect of 
change introduced to system, without following processes 
and notifying other teams. John the Head of Security, 
deployed a tokenization application that affected 
timekeeping and caused payroll failure.
