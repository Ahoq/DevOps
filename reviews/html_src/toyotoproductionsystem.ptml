                    This book talks about the great sucess of Toyoto
                    Production Systems which was developed and promotoed by
                    Toyota Motor Corporation and is being adopted by many
                    Japanese companies in the aftermath of the 1973 oil
                    shock.  The main purpose of the system is to eliminate
                    through improvement activities various kinds of waste lying
                    concealed within a company.

                      This chapter primarily focuses on various important
                      aspects on which total framework of the toyoto
                      production systems lies on.  The topics it highlights
                      are primary purpose, kanban systems, production
                      smoothing, shortening setup time, process layout for
                      shortened lead times and one-piece production,
                      standardization of operations, autonomation, improvement
                      activities, the Goal of TPS. <br>

                      The author describes about each topic in much detail and
                      in great depth.  He talks about how did toyoto achieved
                      its primary goal of profit through cost reduction by
                      employing good strategies like elimination of
                      overproduction, limiting excess inventory and
                      overproduction, reducing unncessary capital
                      investments. <br>

                      Quantity control, quality assurance, respect for
                      umanity are other important points in the framework of
                      toyoto production systems.  To achieve continous flow in
                      the production, Just-in-Time and automation were
                      introduced.  Other important systems like kanban systems
                      were introduced to complement the goals of toyoto
                      production systems but kanban systems do not make up the
                      complete framework. <br>

                        Another important point was discussed in this chapter
                        relating to the production of the toyoto production
                        systems.  They could eleminate unnecessary inventories
                        and capital investments by employing methods like
                        production smoothing which stated that there should
                        be a production of item when it is able to sell enough
                        in the market or when the market demands that
                        particular product for that day.  <br>

                      This chapter discusses all the important steps regarding
                      a JIT process and also gives a case study about
                      introduction of JIT at Toyo aluminum.  <br>
                      Steps given in the book (on page 25) are: <br>
                      1. Upper Management Plays a Key Role <br>
                      2. Establish a Project Team <br>
                      3. Prepare an Implementation Schedule and Set Goals to
                      Be Achieved within the Schedule <br>
                      4. Introduce a Pilot Project  <br>
                      5. Move from a Downstream Process to an Upstream Process <br> <br>

                      The JIT process starts off with the upper management
                      which makes the crucial decisions regarding the
                      production design, plan and allotmenet of resources for
                      the lower employess.  This step is followed by
                      establishing a JIT team which overlooks all the processes
                      related to the JIT process, this team consists of
                      sectional and sub-sectional managers.  These managers
                      make up plans which needs to be followed by other
                      employees to meed the deadlines then implement the last
                      step to move a downstream process to an upstream
                      process. <br> <br>

                      This chapter also introduces other important concepts
                      which can be used to implement JIT like 5S concept
                      (Seiri (arrangement), Seiton (tidiness), Seiso (cleaning)
                      , Seiketsu (cleanliness), and Shitsuke (training)),
                      one-piece-production, automation, kanban cards systems. <br>

                      The other part of this chapter deals about a case study
                      about introduction of JIT at Toyo Aluminum.  It talk
                      about how they followed all the steps which are listed
                      above.  There campaigns included "JUMP 60" & "GO GO
                      Campaign".

                      This chapter discusses about how kanban systems where
                      implemented within Toyota Production System to implement
                      JIT.  As previously stated that kanban systems on a
                      whole don't make up the toyoto production systems but
                      kanban systems just complement the JIT. The author
                      defines the pull system as "The subsequent process of
                      withdrawing the parts from the preceding process". The
                      author subsequently explains that final assembly line
                      pulls the necessary products as they know the exact
                      quantity of parts required and then subsequent processes
                      utilize them. <br> <br>

                      The author talks about various types of kanbans like
                      withdrawal kanban and production-ordering kanban.

                      The author talks about how a kanban can be implemented
                      effectively in JIT process of a toyoto production
                      systems by stating few rules and talking about why
                      those rules are important for JIT. (These rules are
                      very specific to the toyoto production systems).  The
                      rest of the chapter author talks about various kanban
                      systems like express kanban, emergency kanban, job-order
                      kanban, through kanban, common kanban, card or truck as
                      kanban.
