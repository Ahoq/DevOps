                    This book talks about the great sucess of Toyoto
                    Production Systems which was developed and promotoed by
                    Toyota Motor Corporation and is being adopted by many
                    Japanese companies in the aftermath of the 1973 oil
                    shock.  The main purpose of the system is to eliminate
                    through improvement activities various kinds of waste lying
                    concealed within a company.

                          <li>Profit through Cost Reduction: <br>
                            primary goal of the Toyota Production System is
                            cost reduction, or improvement of productivity.
                            We can achieve the cost reduction by elimination of
                             excessive inventory and excessive workforce.
                          </li>
                          <li>Elimination of Overproduction: <br>
                            The most important part of Toyota Production
                            System is to reduce costs by completely
                            eliminating waste.  There are four kinds of waste
                            in manufacturing production operations:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Excessive production resources: <br>
                                people, equipment, materials, or products are
                                categorized as production resources, they only
                                increase cash outlay (costs) and add no value
                                when are in excess.
                              </li>
                              <li>Overproduction: <br>
                                Overproduction is to continue working when
                                essential operations should be stopped.
                              </li>
                              <li>Excessive inventory: <br>
                                Having lots of extra inventory makes us hire
                                more people, procure more equipment and have
                                more floor space to transport and stock the
                                inventory.
                              </li>
                              <li>Unnecessary capital investment: <br>
                                For handling all those excessive items, we end
                                up spending unnecessary capital.
                              </li>

                            This is the most important goal of Toyota
                            production system because reducing costs without
                            implementing this goal is of no use.  And all the
                            3 goals Quanity Control, quality assurance and
                            respect for humanity should be achieved combined.
                            <ul>
                              <li>Quantity control, which enables the system
                                to adapt to daily and monthly fluctuations in
                                demand of quantity and variety
                              </li>
                              <li>Quality assurance, which assures that each
                              process will supply only good units to
                              subsequent processes
                              </li>
                              <li>Respect for humanity, or morale, which must
                                be cultivated while the system utilizes human
                                resources to attain its cost objectives
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Just-in-Time and Autonomation: <br>
                            Just-in-Time and Autonomation are the key
                            concepts to establish continuous flow in the
                            production. <br>
                            Just-in-time (JIT) basically means to produce the
                            necessary units in the necessary quantities at the
                            necessary time. Automation may be loosely
                            interpreted as autonomous defects control.
                          </li>
                          <li>Flexible Workforce and Originality and Ingenuity:
                            <br>
                            Flexible workforce means varying the number of
                            workers to demand changes, and creative thinking
                            or inventive ideas means capitalizing on worker
                            suggestions. <br>

                            The following systems and methods can be used to
                            achieve this goal: <br>

                        Kanban system is a part of Toyoto Production Systems,
                        it is an information system which harmoniously controls
                        the production quantities in every process.  <br>
                        Two kinds are mainly used: the withdrawal kanban and
                        the productionordering kanban. A withdrawal kanban
                        details the quantity which the subsequent process
                        should withdraw, while a production-ordering Kanban
                        shows the quantity which the preceding process must
                        produce.</p>
