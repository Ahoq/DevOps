                <P>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created
                by seventeen software developers in 2001. The Agile Manifesto
                expressed four key values and twelve principles of Agile
                software development. Based on the values and principles 
                stated in the Agile Manifesto, Agile software development
                utilizes the iterative approach that delivers new pieces 
                of the application more often and provides greater 
                fiexibility than the waterfall approach.</P>
