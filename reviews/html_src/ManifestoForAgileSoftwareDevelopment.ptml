                <P>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created
                by seventeen software developers in 2001. The Agile Manifesto
                expressed four key values and twelve principles of Agile
                software development. Based on the values and principles
                stated in the Agile Manifesto, Agile software development
                utilizes the iterative approach that delivers new pieces
                of the application more often and provides greater
                fiexibility than the waterfall approach.</P>
                <P>The first key value of the Agile Manifesto is to value
                people over process. If one company value processes and
                tools, the processes are on average more clear but
                processes will be gradually out of date due to the lack
                of updates. New processes and tools are created by humans.
                In a human-centric company, the improvement in processes
                and tools increases productivity.</P>
                <p>
                  The highest priority is for customer. As we see in the
                  manifesto, the agile development delivers the new
                  versions as soon as possible. In this case, the products
                  can be quickly updated and upgraded to meet the customers'
                  needs. Meanwhile, Pushing the changes quickly for the
                  products also gather customers' feedback soon and is
                  of great help for the products.
              </p>
              <p>
                Changing requirements is welcome in agile development.
                Since agile devolvement iterates fast.
                Changing requirements allow the developers reacts quickly
                to customers' needs, which not only improves the feedback,
                but also the product quality.

                Shorter timescale are perferred. As in small batch work, the
                defects and problems can be easily detected and resolved early.
                The shorter timescale also helps the developers to identify the
                problems precisely.
