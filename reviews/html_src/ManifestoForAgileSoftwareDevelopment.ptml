                  The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created
                  by seventeen software developers in 2001. The Agile Manifesto
                  expressed four key values and twelve principles of Agile
                  software development. Based on the values and principles
                  stated in the Agile Manifesto, Agile software development
                  utilizes the iterative approach that delivers new pieces
                  of the application more often and provides greater
                  fiexibility than the waterfall approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The first key value of the Agile Manifesto is to value
                  people over process. If one company value processes and
                  tools, the processes are on average more clear but
                  processes will be gradually out-of-date due to the lack
                  of updates. New processes and tools are created by humans.
                  In a human-centric company, the improvement in processes
                  and tools increases productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The highest priority is for customer. As we see in the
                  manifesto, the agile development delivers the new
                  versions as soon as possible. In this case, the products
                  can be quickly updated and upgraded to meet the customers'
                  needs. Meanwhile, Pushing the changes quickly for the
                  products also gather customers' feedback soon and is
                  of great help for the products.
              </p>
              <p>
                Changing requirements is welcome in agile development.
                Since agile devolvement iterates fast.
                Changing requirements allow the developers reacts quickly
                to customers' needs, which not only improves the feedback,
                but also the product quality. Shorter timescale are perferred.
                As in small batch work, the defects and problems can be easily
                detected and resolved early. It also helps the developers to
                identify the problems precisely.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the principles is business people and developers must
                work together daily. The communication is of great importance
                in devops, as listed above, the requirments are changing and
                highest pirority is for customer, working together helps the
                developers quickly notice the requirment change and react.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second key value shows that working software is more
                important than comprehensive documentation. As stated in the
                principle, working software is the primary way to measure the
                progress. In that case, a working software is more persuading
                than documentation. The teammates are more likely to honor your
                progress by the working software instead of the documentation.
                However, the documentation can be the resource that assists
                the understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                As said in above, in order to show the progress, the quick
                delivery of the working software helps. The shorter timescale
                informs others the progress and improves the communication.
                It also reduces the work of detailed documentation because some
                work are self-explaining, which is more smoothly than the
                detailed documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third key value of the Agile Manifesto is to focus on
                collaboration between development team and customer, instead of
                emphasizing negotiation. Collaboration will produce more
                valuable product since the customer is involved to provide
                helpful feedbacks to increase values of the product during the
                sprint review. In addition, technologies and customer's needs
                are rapidly changing, hence it's hard to determine all the
                details of the product at the very beginning. By collaborating,
                the development team can integrate needed changes with existing
                product smoothly.
