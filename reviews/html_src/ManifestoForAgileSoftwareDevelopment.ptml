        <P>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created by 
        seventeen software developers in 2001. The Agile Manifesto expressed 
        four key values and twelve principles of Agile software development. 
        Based on the values and principles stated in the Agile Manifesto, 
        Agile software development utilizes the iterative approach that 
        delivers new pieces of the application more often and provides 
        greater fiexibility than the waterfall approach.</P>
