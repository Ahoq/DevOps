                    This book talks about the great sucess of Toyoto
                    Production Systems which was developed and promotoed by
                    Toyota Motor Corporation and is being adopted by many
                    Japanese companies in the aftermath of the 1973 oil
                    shock.  The main purpose of the system is to eliminate
                    through improvement activities various kinds of waste lying
                    concealed within a company.

                        <ul>
                          <li>Profit through Cost Reduction: <br>
                            primary goal of the Toyota Production System is
                            cost reduction, or improvement of productivity.
                            We can achieve the cost reduction by elimination of
                             excessive inventory and excessive workforce.
                          </li>
                          <li>Elimination of Overproduction: <br>
                            The most important part of Toyota Production
                            System is to reduce costs by completely
                            eliminating waste.  There are four kinds of waste
                            in manufacturing production operations:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Excessive production resources: <br>
                                people, equipment, materials, or products are
                                categorized as production resources, they only
                                increase cash outlay (costs) and add no value
                                when are in excess.
                              </li>
                              <li>Overproduction: <br>
                                Overproduction is to continue working when
                                essential operations should be stopped.
                              </li>
                              <li>Excessive inventory: <br>
                                Having lots of extra inventory makes us hire
                                more people, procure more equipment and have
                                more floor space to transport and stock the
                                inventory.
                              </li>
                              <li>Unnecessary capital investment: <br>
                                For handling all those excessive items, we end
                                up spending unnecessary capital.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Unnecessary capital investment include the
                            following: <br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Building a warehouse to store extra

                              <li>Hiring extra workers to transport the

                              <li>Quantity control, which enables the system
                                to adapt to daily and monthly fluctuations in
                                demand of quantity and variety

                            Just-in-time (JIT) basically means to produce the
                            necessary units in the necessary quantities at the
                            necessary time. Automation may be loosely
                            interpreted as autonomous defects control.

                            Flexible workforce means varying the number of
                            workers to demand changes, and creative thinking

                        details the quantity which the subsequent process
                        should withdraw, while a production-ordering Kanban

                            <li>
                              The team set a goal to reduce lead time by 50
                              percent. They then set four subgoals to help
                              realize the final objective.

                          The purpose of GO GO campaign was to reduce five
                          main items by 50 percent during a two and one-half
                          year period from June 1985–December 1987.  <br>

                        <p>
                          Those five items were defective products, setup time,
                          machinery breakdowns, WIP and total lead time. <br>
                          The objective of the Jump 60 campaign was to increase
                           productivity and decrease costs by the time the
                           company reached its 60th anniversary in 1991. <br>
                          The goal of 34,000t was aimed to increase the present
                          production capacity of 31,000t by 10 percent per year
                          without additional capital investment or worker
                          transfers. <br>
                          The three subgoals for these reductions are Zero,
                          Less, and Up.
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Zero means the plant was accident free
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Less means reduction of setup time and WIP
                              inventories

                              Up in the Jump 60 campaign is composed of three
                              components: manpower capacity, machine
                              efficiency, and material efficiency
