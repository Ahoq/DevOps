        <h4>Chapter 1: UNIX for Beginners</h4>

        <p>
            The first chapter goes over introducing the basics of the unix 
            system as well as giving an idea about the structure of the rest 
            of the book. The book assumes that the reader has some familirity 
            with using a terminal. The book also requires a copy of the 
            <i>Programmer's Manual</i>. The objective of the chapter is to 
            get the user started with his/her system as soon as possible.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The chapter is split into three sections:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Basics</b> - logging, basic commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Day-to-day use</b> - filesystems, printing, commonly 
                    used commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Command interpreter</b> - filename shorthands, pipes, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Chapter 2: The File System</h4>

        <p>
            Everything in UNIX is a file. This is the fundamental principle 
            dating from the very beginining of UNIX. This approach was decided 
            as an example of the "Keep It Simple" policy. This chapter dwells 
            into the fundamentals of files and directories, permissions, 
            inodes, and finally on the directory hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Files are a sequence of bytes. File types are not determined by 
            the file system and the kernel treats every file as a sequence of 
            bytes. The command <i>file</i> makes an educated guess at the 
            type of file by using magic numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every file has has permissions, restricting who can read, write or 
            execute the file. However, every system has a <i>Super user</i>, 
            who can read, write, or execute any file on the system. A user can 
            use a program called <i>crypt</i> to encrypt his/her files, which 
            can prevent the superuser cannot modify the file. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All the admnistrative components of a file, such as the name, 
            permissions, and modification times are stored separately as 
            inodes. Inodes themselves are files, and keep the contents of the 
            files separate from the administrative metadata. This increases 
            access times, as many a times the contents of the file are not 
            required, but only the administrative metadata.
        </p>
