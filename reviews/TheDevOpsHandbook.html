        associated with it.Some of the common myths are listed below:</p>

            <li>DevOps is only for Startups:</li>
            <li>DevOps replaces the agile:</li>
            <li>DevOps is incompatible with Information Security and Compliance:</li>
            <li>DevOps means eliminating IT Operations or "NoOps":</li>
            <li>Devops is only an open source software:</li>
