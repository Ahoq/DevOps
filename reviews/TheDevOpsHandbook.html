        <p>This book will give us an insight as to how we can create world 
        class agility, reliability and security in technology organisation.
        This book helps us to understand and replicate the DevOps 
        transformation we have been a part of and also eliminate the myths
        associated with it.Some of the common myths are listed below:</p>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>DevOps is only for Startups</li>
            <li>DevOps replaces Agile</li>
            <li>DevOps is incompatible with Information Security and Compliance</li>
            <li>DevOps means eliminating IT Operations or "NoOps"</li>
            <li>Devops is only an open source software movement</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
         The lean movement started in 1980s when several techniques like Value 
         Stream Mapping, Kanban Boards, and Total Productive Maintenance was

         of belief is 
        </p>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>The Manufacturing lead time to convert raw materials to finished
            products would lead to the best judgement of customer satisfation,
            quality and employee satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>The Manufacturing short time would be judged by the small batch
                sizes of work.
            </li>
        </ul>

            and principles were required to be created against the software 
            development model like the waterfall model. The key principle of
            the Agile manifesto was :-

        <ul class="nested">
            <li>To deliver working software frequently, from a couple of 
            weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter
            timescale</li>
            <li>There was a need for small,self motivated teams working in 
            a high trust management model.</li>
        </ul>
