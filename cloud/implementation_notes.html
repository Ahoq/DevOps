        <p>    The service which we choose to use will highly depend on requirement of development and deployment team.
</p><p>Cloud services come in three forms- SAAS,PAAS, IAAS.
</p><p>
SAAS- When software developed by cloud service provider is used to manage technical task of an organization.
</p><p>
PAAS- when cloud service provider provides an environment to host client's software.
</p><p>
IAAS - when whole computing infrastructure is provided by cloud service provider.
</p><p>
We decided to go with following cloud service providers-
</p><p><br/>
SAAS - Salesforce<br/>
PAAS- Heroku<br/>
IAAS - AWS
