                    Why deploy to the cloud instead of managing one's own
                    infrastructure? One reason is to let the pros at managing a
                    data center manage your data center for you: instead,
                    concentrate on the things you do best, like being a
                    restaurant, or a shoe manufacturer, or a mortgage broker.
