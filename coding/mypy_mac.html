        <p>
            In this webpage we are going to show how to install
            mypy swiftly for Mac. To use mypy, You need Python 3.4 or later.
            You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x)
            installed on the same system without problems.
        </p>

        <h4> 
            1.Check your python version
        </h4>

        <p>
            Run the following command in terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
           <code> python3 </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This command should show your latest python version
            if you have python later than python3. If the system
            do not know this command or your python version is not
            later than Python 3.4, you need to install the newest python.

        <p>
            As you can see that my python version is later than python-3.4,
            so I don't need to install another python. Otherwise you can find
            the latest python on
