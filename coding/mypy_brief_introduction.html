        <p>
            In this webpage we are trying to introduce Mypy to you.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What is mypy?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Mypy is actually not a kind of programming language,it is a type
            checker, and a semantics error checker. By using
            <span style="color: #0000f0; text-decoration: underline ">
                'mypy'</span> command
            to run your code instead of using
            <span style="color: #0000f0; text-decoration: underline ">
                'python'</span> command, you can find bugs in your programs
            without even running them.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What should we know to start using mypy?
        </h4>
        <p>
            We need to install mypy on the computer first. The mypy commond is
            always combine with the python syntax called
            <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">
                Type Hints
            </a> . By adding typy hints to your python code, mypy can find the
            type error easily. For other information please go to
