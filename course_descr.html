        <p>
            DevOps is an umbrella term covering the latest thinking in software
            development and computer center operations. It encompasses Lean and
            Agile development practices, software as infrastructure for
            automating IT configuration and deployment, automated testing, 
            continuous integration, continuous delivery, version control
            systems, value-stream mapping,
            and other technological practices. But first and foremost,
            DevOps means breaking down the barriers between business units,
            development teams, quality assurance, security, and operations,
            barriers that all too often wind up blocking the creation of
            value-generating software.
